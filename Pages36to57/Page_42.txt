STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Omvendelse – carries biblical-theological sense of repentance/turning, not mere reform.
* Forhærdelse – spiritual hardening; must retain moral-theological weight.
* Fordærvelse – corruption leading to destruction; not mere decay.
* Egenrettidige – self-righteous, but with clerical hypocrisy implied.
* Verdensmagterne – world powers as objects of misplaced trust.
* Raabte – proclamatory, sermonic crying, not casual saying.
* Solgt til Undergang – sold over to destruction; passive judgment nuance.
* Sikkerhedens og Sorgløshedens tunge Betænke – heavy, soporific cushions of false security.
* Veerne – birth pangs; biblical eschatological image.
* Marv – marrow; core vitality.
* Raadløs – without counsel, abandoned.
* Bortførelsens Dom – judgment of exile.
* Luer – flames; consuming fire.
* Kaardføre – sword-bearing, warlike.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with cumulative clauses and rhetorical escalation.
* Parallel cries of kings, priests, and prophets.
* Extended historical-theological narration without paragraph breaks.
* Metaphorical chains that must not be broken into short modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Repentance versus hardening; divine judgment unfolding through history.
* False security preached by clergy.
* Misplaced political trust versus trust in the Lord.
* Judgment as both moral consequence and divine act.
* Exile and temple destruction as covenantal judgment.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic urgency and prophetic denunciation.
* Solemn, lamenting historical retrospection.
* Moral indictment addressed to the conscience of a people.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Fred, Fred og ingen Fare” – echoes Jer. 6:14; false proclamation of peace.
* “sov og slumrede sødeligt” – spiritual sleep; complacency.
* “sov bort sin Ret og sit Kald” – sleeping away one’s calling; forfeiture through negligence.
* “Veerne over den frugtsommelige” – labor pains upon a pregnant woman; sudden, unavoidable judgment (cf. 1 Thess. 5:3).
* “udhulde Folkets Marv” – hollowing out the people’s vitality.

KJV-style equivalents are appropriate for peace/peace, sleep, birth pangs, destruction, and judgment language.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Contrast between Josiah’s time and the period after his death.
* Rise of corrupt leadership: kings, priests, prophets.
* False assurances leading to spiritual sleep and loss of calling.
* Internal decay preceding external judgment.
* Political opportunism leading to universal contempt and invasion.
* Sequential instruments of judgment: Assyria, Egypt, Babylon.
* Transition to hope-in-history: rise of Persia against Babylon.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah’s denunciations of false peace (Jer. 6:14; 8:11).
* Birth pang imagery (Isa. 13:8; 1 Thess. 5:3).
* Isaiah 8:6–8 explicitly cited.
* Covenant judgment themes from Kings and Chronicles.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain prophetic severity and lament.
* Retain accusation against leadership.
* Preserve inevitability and suddenness of judgment.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Expressions of inevitability (“uafvendelig”) must be rendered as unavoidably/inescapably.
* Divine judgment presented as certain, not hypothetical.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Omvendelse – repentance
* Herren – the LORD
* Dom – judgment
* Ødelæggelse – destruction
* Bortførelse – exile

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sleep imagery
* Birth pangs
* Hollowed marrow
* Flooding of the land
* Fire consuming the temple

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From hopeful call to repentance → grim inevitability → catastrophic judgment → distant historical turning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences with rhythmic clauses.
* Allow accumulative force and sermonic pacing.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING, SVERDRUP PROFILE)

And whereas in the days of Josiah all things seemed to call the people to repentance and to lift them up unto the LORD, so after his death it was as though everything joined together to drive the people inexorably forward toward the goal of their hardening and their corruption. There arose ungodly kings, self-righteous priests, and false prophets. And while the kings turned themselves away from the LORD and sought help from the powers of the world, the priests cried out, “The temple of the LORD,” and the prophets cried, “Peace, peace, and no danger,” until the poor people, who had been sold over to destruction, slept and slumbered sweetly upon the heavy quilts of security and carelessness, so that they slept away their right and their calling. They shut their eyes to the danger, until suddenly destruction stood over them, as travail upon the woman with child.

Thus matters stood inwardly. Priests, prophets, and kings hollowed out the marrow of the people, until it was like dead flesh without heart, without courage, without faith—a helpless mass, whose secret allegiance most often inlined  toward its enemies. And those—yes, those—to whom Judah in haste and in helplessness had bound itself, it had fastened itself to them all. Judah had sought Egypt for help against Assyria, Assyria for help against Egypt, Babylon for support against them both. Now they came upon Judah, whom they all despised. Assyria had already, under Hezekiah and Manasseh, flooded the land of Judah, because it despised the softly flowing waters of Hezekiah (Isa. 8:6–8). Egypt became the instrument that brought death upon the last king of David’s faith, Josiah, in the crushing battle at Megiddo; and Babylon brought the judgment of destruction and of exile to its deepest depth: the holy city became a heap of rubble, while the temple went up in flames.

Meanwhile, in the far East, the foundation was being laid for the kingdom that was to break Israel’s bonds and cast down proud Babylon. The sword-bearing, warlike Persians prepared themselves for conquest against the southern builders of Babylon, enfeebled by debauchery and luxury.
