STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hjerte" used not sentimentally but as the seat of conscience and covenantal faithfulness.
* "Undergang" carries eschatological and covenantal ruin, not mere political defeat.
* "Omvendelse" bears full biblical weight of repentance (metanoia), not moral reform.
* "Huldskab og Troskab" denotes sworn covenant loyalty, not generic allegiance.
* "holde Kiød for sin Arm" is a biblical idiom (cf. Jer. 17:5), meaning trusting human strength.
* "Fristelsen" here refers to existential spiritual trial, not enticement to sin.
* "Dynet" (mire) must retain physical and symbolic degradation.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extended paratactic sentences with semicolon logic must not be fragmented.
* Sermonic repetition ("han saa… han saa…") must be preserved.
* Scriptural quotations embedded in narrative must remain marked yet integrated.

Theological Hazards:

* Repentance, judgment, divine wrath, and salvation are covenantal realities.
* The necessity ("maatte") of judgment must retain divine inevitability.
* Submission to Babylon is presented as obedience to God’s judgment, not pragmatism.

Voice Hazards:

* Lamentational intensity (Jeremiah cursing the day of his birth) must not be softened.
* Prophetic authority and exhortational force must remain direct and grave.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "holde Kiød for sin Arm" – Biblical idiom (Jer. 17:5). KJV parallel: "maketh flesh his arm."
* "udraabe Frihed for Sverdet" – Ironical reversal of Jubilee language (Lev. 25).
* "Frygtens Gjerning, ikke Troens" – Antithesis central to pietistic theology.
* "knuses ved Herrens Ord / Herrens Dom" – Parallel modes of judgment: prophetic vs. historical.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah’s suffering as consequence of faithful witness.
* Israel’s refusal of repentance despite divine invitation.
* Zedekiah’s political apostasy contrasted with prophetic truth.
* False repentance exposed during temporary fear.
* Final inevitability of judgment and intensification of hostility toward the prophet.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah 20:14 – cursing the day of birth.
* Jeremiah 27:17; 34:2; 34 – quoted or paraphrased directly.
* Matthew 22:21 – Christ’s later echo of the same political-theological truth.
* Jeremiah 17:5 – trusting in flesh.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* No mitigation of wrath, judgment, or prophetic suffering.
* Retain existential anguish and divine compulsion.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maatte" rendered as "must" or "was compelled to."
* Conditional inevitability preserved ("if… then must").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Omvendelse = repentance
* Vrede = wrath
* Dom = judgment
* Frelse = salvation
* Frihed (ironical) = liberty

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Crushing, fire, mire, yoke, neck, hand, and arm imagery retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Lament → warning → irony → wrath → deliverance of the prophet.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically necessary.
* Parallelism preserved for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

What had not his faithful heart suffered under this! Day by day he saw his people draw nearer to their destruction; he saw the love of his God, which without ceasing called and allured them unto repentance and salvation, mocked and despised; he himself was persecuted, and saw his life threatened daily by people and priests, by prophets and princes. — And his soul was beaten down in the trial, so that he cursed the day on which he was born. Yet still he was constrained to go with the message of the Lord’s wrath; for if Israel would not be broken by the word of the Lord, then it must be broken by the judgment of the Lord. That judgment was near; Jeremiah was to live to behold it.

The last king before the captivity to Babylon was the weak and faithless Zedekiah. It was Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who, after having carried away Jehoiakim and the best of the people with him, set Zedekiah as king over those who remained in Jerusalem. Zedekiah had sworn loyalty and faithfulness to the king of Babylon, and the kingdom of Judah was tributary to the world-empire. Jeremiah bore witness to the people to the same truth which the Savior later set before Israel, when it was subject to the Roman emperor: “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” But to no avail. Zedekiah trusted in political cunning and made flesh his arm. He entered into alliance with several other petty princes, who like himself were subject to Babylon; and in reliance upon the help of Egypt, he and his confederates broke their oath of loyalty to Nebuchadnezzar, refused to pay their tribute, and set themselves in a posture of defense against the advancing army of Babylon.

Then Jeremiah lifted up his voice in rebuke. As a prophet of the Lord he had borne witness to the people before the uprising and had said: Serve the king of Babylon, and ye shall live (Jer. 27:17). And after the uprising, when the king of Babylon and all his army came to fight against Jerusalem, then his word sounded thus: “Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire” (Jer. 34:2). But Israel would not hear. The people were seized with fear for a little while when the mighty army appeared before the walls of Jerusalem, and in their terror they resolved to release their Hebrew menservants and maidservants, in order thereby to appease the Lord’s wrath and to increase the number of their fighting men. But this was only a work of fear, not of faith; and therefore, when Nebuchadnezzar for a little while withdrew from Jerusalem to meet the Egyptian army, which had indeed gone out against him, then the Jewish masters took back their word and once again deprived their servants of their freedom.

Then the wrath of the Lord was kindled against them, and he sent Jeremiah to say: Ye have proclaimed liberty to your servants, and have taken back that liberty; therefore will I proclaim liberty for the sword, and for the famine, and for the pestilence, to rage among you. And I will bring the army of the Babylonians back unto this city, and they shall fight against it, and they shall take it and burn it with fire; and the cities of Judah will I make a desolation, without inhabitant (Jer. 34).

And the army of Nebuchadnezzar came, never again to depart from Jerusalem until it had been made a heap of ruins. But if the bitterness against Jeremiah had been great while he proclaimed the sentence of punishment, it became doubly violent when the judgment came. It is the dreadful mystery of hardening, that the more clearly the truth shines before the eyes, the more firmly the eye closes itself against it; the heavier the hand of the Lord lies upon it, the more stiffly it raises its neck against the hand that strikes it. And when Jeremiah spoke to the besieged people of the salvation that lay in the humiliating way of surrendering themselves to the king of Babylon, then he could no longer be endured; he had to be bound and cast into prison. And as though it were not enough that he was shut up, the princes would yet take his life by casting him into an empty cistern, where, sinking down into the mire, he was to find death by hunger.

But the Lord had promised to deliver him out of the hand of his enemies; and Ebed-melech obtained from the king permission to rescue him from the pit. And in prison he was forced to remain until the day when Jerusalem was taken.
