STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Trusler" – not mere threats, but covenantal warnings/judgments.
* "Forjættelser" – promissory word of God; must retain biblical weight.
* "Fangenskab" – exile/captivity with redemptive-historical sense.
* "Fredstanker" – echoes Jer. 29:11; peace as salvific intent, not mere calm.
* "forhærdet" – theological hardening, not psychological stubbornness.
* "fuldbyrdet" – completion/bringing to pass of divine counsel.
* "Spaadomme" – prophetic oracles, not generic predictions.
* "Sønderknuselse" / "Opreisning" – destruction and restoration with spiritual force.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with causal chains ("Det er, fordi …").
* Biblical citation lists embedded mid-sentence.
* Parallel constructions that must remain intact.
* Sermonic pacing that resists sentence fragmentation.

Theological Hazards:

* Judgment and promise must remain inseparably linked.
* Israel and the nations treated within salvation history.
* Divine wrath and divine faithfulness both fully asserted.

Voice Hazards:

* Risk of flattening exhortational, didactic tone.
* Risk of modernizing prophetic register.
* Risk of weakening solemn, authoritative cadence.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "samle alle sine Trusler og Forjættelser til sit Folk i en Bog" – covenant document motif; echoes Deut. 31.
* "vende sit Folks Israels Fangenskab om" – standard prophetic idiom for restoration from exile.
* "udøst sin brændende Vrede" – sacrificial/libation imagery; divine judgment poured out.
* "slaa og lægende Olje og Vin" – Luke 10 echo (Good Samaritan); judgment and healing together.
  KJV-style equivalents are natural throughout ("turn again the captivity," "pour out his fierce anger").

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Divine command to write explained by God himself.
* Threefold reason: hearing, future restoration, future understanding.
* Jeremiah’s calling defines both life and book.
* Dual prophetic office: tearing down and building up.
* Book structure mirrors calling: Israel first, then nations.
* Final appendix underscores Jerusalem’s destruction as interpretive key.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah 30:1–3; 30:24; 36:2–3 explicitly cited.
* Jer. 29:11 echoed in "Fredstanker".
* Exile/restoration language throughout prophets.
* Oil and wine imagery recalls Luke 10 and Isaianic healing motifs.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Judgment language kept severe.
* Promises articulated with covenantal certainty.
* Didactic and exhortational tone retained.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "vil" and "skal" rendered as strong futurity ("will," "shall").
* No weakening into possibility or suggestion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Trusler → judgments/warnings
* Forjættelser → promises
* Fangenskab → captivity
* Fredstanker → thoughts of peace
* Spaadomme → prophecies/oracles

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Oil and wine metaphor preserved intact.
* Tearing down / building up retained as structural imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Judgment vs. restoration clearly contrasted.
* Severity and consolation not blended.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long periodic sentences preserved.
* Semicolon pivots retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Also the prophet Jeremiah was to write in a book what the LORD caused him to see. Why he was to do this, the LORD himself has explained in Jeremiah 30:1–3; 30:24; and 36:2–3. It is because the LORD still wills to gather all his judgments and his promises to his people into a book, if so be that they might be willing to hearken unto them. It is because in the latter days he will turn again the captivity of his people Israel and bring them back to the land which he gave unto their fathers; then shall they acknowledge his faithfulness. It is because Israel is now hardened and understands not the good counsel of the LORD and his thoughts of peace toward them; but in the last times, when the LORD has poured out his burning wrath upon his people and upon the proud heathen, when he has fulfilled the thoughts of his heart, then shall they understand it.

We have already seen that the two great matters in Jeremiah’s calling are these: that he is set over nations and kingdoms, and that he is appointed first as a prophet of destruction and thereafter as a prophet of restoration. We must therefore expect in his book to find prophecies against Israel and prophecies against the heathen, and that these prophecies must contain, first and foremost, proclamation of judgment and thereafter promise of salvation.

And so it is indeed the case that, just as the prophet’s life was governed by the divine calling, so also his book is determined thereby and ordered according to its content. Over Jews and heathen he is set, and his book of prophecy sets forth truer words for them both. Crushing and raising up were to mark his labor, and his book is a mighty juxtaposition of smiting and healing oil and wine poured into deep wounds.

The prophet’s book is divided into two principal parts, according to the order: the Jew first and then the heathen. The first principal part consists of the first forty-five chapters and is directed chiefly to Israel. The second principal part is chapters 46–51, where the prophet turns to the heathen; to this chapter 52 is added as an appendix, which once more recounts the destruction of Jerusalem, a matter so dreadful and so grave in Jeremiah’s entire prophecy and life.
