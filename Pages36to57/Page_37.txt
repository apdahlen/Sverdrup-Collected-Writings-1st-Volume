STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Frelsesraad” – salvation-counsel/plan of salvation with Pauline and salvation-historical weight.
* “Tidens Fylde” – biblical technical term (Gal. 4:4), not generic “fullness of time.”
* “Tildækkelse” – veiling/covering; salvation-historical concealment.
* “Forhærdelses Maal” – measure/fullness of hardening (Rom. 11 resonance).
* “Husholdning” – oikonomia; divine economy.
* “Eiendom” – treasured possession (Exod. 19).
* “Forbryderdøden” – criminal’s death; judicial-executive execution.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, layered sentences with theological causality.
* Parallel constructions contrasting belief/unbelief.
* Sermonic rhythm with cumulative clauses.

Theological Hazards:

* Election, hardening, divine sovereignty vs. human responsibility.
* Christ as true Israel and Seed of Abraham (Gal. 3).
* Prophetic office as both promise and judgment.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone.
* Sharp rebuke of presumption and false security.
* Do not modernize or sentimentalize.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Mange er kaldede, faa udvalgte” – Matthew 22:14.
* “Hellig Folk… Folk til Eiendom” – Exodus 19:5–6; 1 Peter 2:9.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* God’s salvation plan is completed in Christ.
* Israel’s history prepares either faith or rejection.
* Prophecy interprets Israel’s position in salvation history.
* All peoples serve God’s counsel, willingly or unwillingly.
* Israel’s calling brings danger of unfaithfulness or pride.
* Prophets exalt the calling and crush presumption.
* Mercy and justice stand equally high in God.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Galatians 3–4: Seed, fullness of time.
* Romans 9–11: hardening, divine economy.
* Luke 17:10: unprofitable servants.
* Matthew 22:14: many called, few chosen.
* Exodus 19; Deuteronomy 7: holy people, treasured possession.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain prophetic severity.
* Preserve sharp warnings against false peace.
* Maintain solemn gravity and urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Tidens Fylde – fullness of time
* Kald – calling
* Forhærdelse – hardening

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Light on the path, filling up a measure, being crushed by justice.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Promise vs. threat.
* Consolation vs. judgment.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

God’s counsel of salvation is accomplished in Israel, whose entire veiling points toward one single goal, Jesus Christ, in whom the counsel of salvation is brought to completion in the fullness of time. Yet as the people of Israel drew nearer to the fullness of time, it was prepared through the Lord’s manifold acts of deliverance, so that it might rightly receive the Savior—or reject Him and give Him the death of a criminal—just as love had resolved, and as love alone could bring to pass. He is the true Israel; He is the Seed, Abraham’s Seed—not many, but one: Christ.

And as the people advanced ever nearer to the fullness of time, so the word of the Lord followed them by the mouth of the prophets, explaining to the people how far they had come, and what the next step would be in the preparation, so that those who did not believe might fill up the measure of their hardening, and those who believed might abide in patience and attain the goal of their faith. Thus the prophetic word is the light and the truth upon the people’s path, pointing toward the goal, while at the same time powerfully and effectually leading the people forward toward that goal.

Every people has its calling in God’s economy. A people may despise its calling, and it perishes; yet even through its perdition it must serve the counsel of the Lord. A people may honor its calling and walk worthy of it; then it is saved, and in being saved it serves the counsel of the Lord willingly. But since both the one who perishes and the one who is saved must serve the Lord, it is no merit for you that you fulfill the counsel of the Lord with all your strength. You have nothing of which to boast; rather you must thank the Lord for everything, for you are only an unprofitable servant, because you did what you were bound to do.

The people of Israel also had its calling. It was to be a holy people, a chosen people, a people for possession, in whose midst the Lord would dwell, that He might be their God, and they His people. But in this Israel stood under the same two dangers that confront everyone whom God has called. The one is to be unfaithful in one’s calling, not to esteem it high and holy as coming from the Holy One; the other is to boast of one’s calling, or to misunderstand it, and from it seek to make oneself a merit. Against these two dangers the prophets must testify and contend.

On high the prophet lifts the people’s calling and its goal. In sharp, mighty words he speaks to the aimless, wavering, halting people of the Lord’s great calling which He gave them, of the great and glorious future which He prepared for them. And with flashing words, full of divine wrath, he strikes down the people’s proud delusion that it already is the Lord’s people merely by right of birth. With burning zeal for the truth he repeats again and again the warning that the people must not forfeit its glorious future through the miserable delusion that it has already reached the goal and may now begin to enjoy its peace. And because it is always so that many are called but few are chosen, and yet the zealous priests would draw all to themselves, therefore the prophets are full of the hidden ways of God and of afflictions, and of sharp threats and judgments; for as high as the Lord’s mercy is, so high is His righteousness, and if sinners will not immerse themselves in the one, they shall surely be overthrown and crushed by the other.
