STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Forunderlige" – not merely "strange" but wondrous, providentially mysterious.
* "Veie" – paths/ways in a theological–providential sense.
* "Forjættelser" – covenantal promises, not generic promises.
* "Spire" – messianic Branch (Jer 23; 33), doctrinally loaded.
* "Ret og Retfærdighed" – judicial and moral righteousness in biblical pairing.
* "fremspire" – organic, divinely caused growth imagery.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with semicolon logic.
* Repetition of "I Fængslet" as rhetorical anchor.
* Embedded quotations from Jeremiah requiring careful cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Restoration theology (death → life).
* Messianic prophecy tied to Davidic covenant.
* Corporate identity: God and His people.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, sermonic tone.
* Providential paradox (light in prison, life in death).

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Herrens Veie" echoes Isa. 55:8–9; Rom. 11:33.
* "bygge og plante" directly from Jer. 1:10.
* Buying the field (Jer. 32) as enacted prophecy.
* Winter–spring metaphor for judgment and restoration.
* "Herren, vor Retfærdighed" – KJV-consistent rendering.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: God’s ways are wondrous and paradoxical.
* Evidence: Jeremiah receives light and promises in prison.
* Doctrinal pivot: Judgment serves restoration.
* Climax: Messianic promise of the righteous Branch.
* Conclusion: Vision extends to the ends of the earth via the Gospel.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah 1:10 (build and plant).
* Jeremiah 32 (purchase of the field).
* Jeremiah 23:5–6; 33:14–16 (righteous Branch).
* Ezekiel 11:19 (one heart and one way).
* Eschatological horizon (Matt. 24; Acts 1:8 by implication).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain paradoxical wonder.
* Preserve prophetic certainty.
* Avoid sentimentalization of suffering.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "vil" retained as strong divine resolve.
* Prophetic declarations rendered without softening.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Lord (Herren)
* Righteousness
* People / God covenantal pairing
* Restoration imagery kept stable.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Prison/light contrast preserved.
* Winter/spring image retained.
* Death yielding life intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Judgment vs. promise.
* Ruins vs. eternal kingdom.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved.
* Repetition maintained.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

Wondrous are the ways of the Lord. There in the prison, where Jeremiah seemed to human eyes truly laid away in darkness, there the Lord caused His light to arise for him and showed him Israel’s glorious future. From prisons there commonly go forth the wildest threats against the people, curses against God and men; but from this prison there go forth the most life‑blessed promises in lovely words, which still gladden the city of God.

Jeremiah, who in the prison waited for the fulfillment of the destruction he had proclaimed, received precisely there also the charge to build and to plant. In the prison Jeremiah was commanded to buy a field which lay trampled beneath the feet of the Chaldeans, a piece of land near Jerusalem, as a sign that when the Chaldeans had destroyed everything, then the Lord would restore everything; that out of death itself the Lord would bring forth life. After this bitter winter there was to break forth a glorious spring.

In the prison Jeremiah received the word of the Lord, that the Lord would gather His people from all the lands to which He had scattered them, and bring them back to this place and cause them to dwell securely. And they should be the Lord’s people, and He their God. And they should be given one heart and one way.

In the prison Jeremiah received that glorious message: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah. In those days, and at that time, will I cause the righteous Branch to spring forth unto David; and He shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby it shall be called: The Lord our Righteousness.”

Thus Jeremiah built and planted a people and a kingdom which should endure forever, in the midst of the ruins of fallen kingdoms and shattered peoples. And in the prison, where the narrow walls shut him in on every side, the prophet’s eye was opened to see unto the last days and unto the farthest ends of the earth, unto the kingdom which by the Gospel comes to all nations.
