STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Fortrin" – not merely advantage, but divinely granted privilege.
* "Eiendommelighed" – defining characteristic, not oddity.
* "skede" – archaic form of "skete" (happened/occurred), here with revelatory force.
* "raad" – counsel, salvific plan, not advice.
* "Frelse" – salvation in a full redemptive, theological sense.
* "Forhærdelse" – hardening of heart, with biblical resonance.
* "Fyrste" – prince, ruler; here Christological.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, chained sentences with semicolons and dashes.
* Sermonic cadence that must not be broken into short sentences.
* Embedded Scripture quotation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of revelation (Word of the Lord coming to prophets).
* Theology of salvation through death.
* Divine sovereignty in salvation history.
* Hardening and faith as instruments in God’s hand.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, didactic, sermonic Lutheran tone.
* Elevated exhortational rhetoric.
* Risk of flattening the majestic cadence.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Herrens Ord skede til dem" – biblical idiom ("the word of the Lord came unto…"). KJV parallel.
* "Livets Vei gaar igjennem Døden" – paradoxical biblical-pietistic formulation.
* "slaa Synden og adsprede Faarene" – salvation through judgment; pastoral-biblical imagery.
* Poetic stanza reflects hymnody; must retain meter-like dignity.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The prophets are Israel’s great privilege because God’s Word was entrusted to them.
* Definition: A prophet is one to whom the Word of the Lord comes.
* Doctrinal claim: God’s salvific counsel must be revealed, as it surpasses human thought.
* Central paradox: Life comes through death.
* Application: Prophets proclaim this way; the people either reject or believe.
* Conclusion: God’s counsel stands unshaken and is fulfilled regardless.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Deuteronomy 18:18 explicitly quoted – should echo KJV phrasing.
* Isaiah 55:8 implicit (God’s thoughts higher than man’s).
* John 12 / Romans 11 implicit (hardening as divine instrument).
* Shepherd imagery (scattered sheep).
* Christological echo: "Livets Fyrste" (Acts 3:15 – Prince of Life).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Do not soften the paradox of salvation through death.
* Maintain firmness regarding divine sovereignty.
* Preserve exhortational and declarative force.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must."
* Divine necessity retained, not weakened to possibility.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Fortrin → privilege
* Frelse → salvation
* Raad → counsel
* Ord → Word
* Folk → people

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Retain death–life paradox.
* Retain shepherd and prince imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward unbelief.
* Confidence and consolation in God’s unshakable counsel.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences.
* Maintain rhetorical pauses via commas, semicolons, and dashes.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\subsection{The Prophet Jeremiah}

[Source: Quarterly Writings. Third Year. 1877. Pages 113–137. — Ed. 1.]

The prophets of the Old Covenant are the great and glorious privilege of the people of Israel, grounded in this, that Israel was the people of God. For it is the privilege of God’s people that the Word of God is entrusted to them; but the distinctive mark of the prophets, that which makes them to be called prophets, is precisely this, that the Word of the Lord came unto them, and that they proclaimed it to the people. A concept may indeed be formed of what a prophet is, yet none is simpler than this: “A Prophet will I raise up unto them from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him” (Deut. 18:18).

God’s wondrous counsel of salvation with His people and with the world—that is God’s thought; and because the thought of the Lord is higher than the thought of men, therefore it must be revealed in the Word of the Lord. There may be many deep thoughts of men and many lofty human plans, but that which the natural man does not comprehend is this, that the way of life passes through death, both for the individual and for the people. It is the Lord alone who has conceived this, it is the Lord alone who has understood it, and it is the Lord alone who has accomplished the salvation of His people by smiting sin and scattering the sheep, by crushing unto death the Prince of Life.

—It is this way of salvation which the prophets are to proclaim to the people. The people believe it not, and their hardening becomes one of the means in the hand of the Lord whereby His plan is fulfilled. —The people believe it, and the faith of the people becomes another means for the advancement of the Lord’s will; for
