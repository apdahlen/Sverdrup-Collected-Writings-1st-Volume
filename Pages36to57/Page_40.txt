STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Vinstok" as covenantal/biblical metaphor (cf. Ps. 80; Isa. 5; Jer. 2), not mere vineyard imagery.
* "Tilredt" meaning ravaged, laid waste, not prepared.
* "Tun og bændede" meaning waiting tensely/straining forward.
* "Forhærdelse" as theological hardening, not psychological stubbornness.
* "Straffedom" as punitive judgment with divine agency.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extended metaphor sustained across long clauses.
* Periodic sentences with delayed main verbs.
* Semicolon logic indicating theological pivots.
* Embedded scriptural quotations integrated into prose.

Theological Hazards:

* Covenant election of Israel/Judah.
* Relationship between faith, promise, and continuance.
* Hardening leading to judgment as divine action.
* Word of the Lord as life-giving or destructive.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic, prophetic cadence.
* Earnest exhortation and warning.
* Elevated, solemn tone that resists modernization.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* Vine imagery: rooted in Psalm 80 and Isaiah 5; signifies Israel as God’s cultivated people.
* "Land flowing with milk and honey": Exodus covenant promise.
* "What portion have we in David?": 1 Kings 12:16, schism formula.
* "Word of the Lord as hammer": Jeremiah 23:29.
* KJV diction naturally aligns with these images.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening metaphor: Israel/Judah as ruined vine.
* Historical contrast: Davidic-Solomonic flourishing vs. present ruin.
* Schism as decisive apostasy of Israel.
* Judah’s greater privilege and responsibility.
* Central thesis: everything in Judah depended on faith.
* Hardening leads inexorably to judgment.
* Isaiah 6 as scriptural proof.
* Conclusion: prophetic word and imperial judgment advance together.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Psalm 80:8–11 (vine imagery).
* Isaiah 5; Jeremiah 2 (vine metaphor).
* 1 Kings 12:16 (schism cry).
* Isaiah 7:9 (“If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established”).
* Isaiah 6:9–13 quoted at length.
* Jeremiah 23:29 (hammer imagery).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings remain uncompromised.
* Divine agency in judgment preserved.
* No sentimental softening of destruction or hardening.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity (“must,” “shall”) retained.
* Conditional warnings remain absolute.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Forhærdelse = hardening.
* Dom / Straffedom = judgment.
* Herrens Ord = the Word of the Lord.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Vine imagery preserved throughout.
* Hammer/rock metaphor retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Hope in promise vs. severity of judgment clearly contrasted.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved.
* Sermonic rhythm maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

Israel’s People in the Time of Jeremiah

The fair vine which the Lord had planted in the land that flowed with milk and honey was at this time already grievously laid waste. In the victorious and peaceful days of David and Solomon it had struck its roots deep and spread itself wide; it had sent forth its branches unto the sea and its shoots unto the river. But now its walls were broken down; all that passed by plucked at it. Its crown and trunk were felled to the dust, and one part was hewn off and cast far away beyond the Euphrates. The kingdom of Israel was no more; and the kingdom of Judah, which still remained, was like the vine that beareth no grapes: there is no joy in it and there is no profit in it; it yieldeth no wine, and its wood is good for nothing. The kingdom of Judah stood straining and waiting for the axe which had cut down the kingdom of Israel to be lifted a second time and to fall dripping upon the golden tendril.

The kingdom of Israel had never had any better future in store for it from the day when it said, “What portion have we in David? we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! now see to thine own house, David.” By this it had entered upon the path of decay; it had reckoned itself among the heathen nations and had thus voluntarily chosen the portion of the heathen, which is death by the power of the kingdoms of this world. The kingdom of Judah, on the other hand, had better ordinances and better hope; for the house of David had the promise of abiding for ever, and the temple of the Lord had the promise that it should become a house of prayer for all peoples. And the word of the Lord dwelt in Judah, and was God’s power and hammer-wedge for the little afflicted people who from the valleys of Judah went up to Jerusalem, the lofty-built city upon the mountains, round about which the Lord was wall and rampart, the wondrous city in which the nations should be born anew.

But in Judah everything depended upon this one thing—upon faith. “If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.” Human malice could not make void the faithfulness of God; but if Judah would not believe, would not drink of the fountain that giveth strength unto everlasting life, then must the crushing judgment pass over the people of hardening. And thus it came to pass. The kingdom of Judah set its neck and a hardened heart against the word of the Lord; therefore the word of the Lord became a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces. Hardening and destruction follow one another as death and corruption.

There is a place in the word of God which sets before us this inevitable connection between hardening and corruption; it is the sixth chapter of the prophet Isaiah. In the year of King Uzziah’s death the prophet receiveth this command: “Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.” Then said the prophet, “Lord, how long?” And he answered, “Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate; and the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.” From this hour onward, the growing hardening and the judgment that draweth ever nearer and nearer are the history of Israel. The growing hardening is this, that the word of the Lord soundeth early and continually and is not heeded; the advancing judgment is this, that the birds of prey of the world-kingdoms gather more and more closely over the stiffened nobility, the kingdom of Judah. The Lord suffered both to come to pass. He sent His prophets early and continually unto a gainsaying people; and as ungodliness increased, He raised up the mighty kingdoms of the world, the rod of His wrath over the nations, and above all over the chosen people.
