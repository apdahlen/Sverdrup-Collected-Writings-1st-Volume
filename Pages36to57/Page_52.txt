STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Bodsprædikener" – penitential sermons; carries strong Lutheran/pietistic sense of repentance unto amendment, not mere moral exhortation.
* "Omvendelsesprofet" – prophet of repentance/conversion; must retain theological force of turning to God.
* "Forhærdede" / "Forstoknede" – hardened, stiff‑necked; biblical idiom with judicial overtones.
* "Sønderknuselsens Frugt" – fruit of contrition/brokenness; must not be psychologized.
* "Naadens Straaler" – rays of grace; metaphorical, soteriological.
* "Sanddruhed" – truthfulness/fidelity; older moral-theological term.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with embedded relative clauses and semicolon logic.
* Rhetorical exclamations embedded within narrative prose.
* Parallel constructions that must remain parallel in English.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of repentance, divine judgment, hardening, and grace.
* Prophetic authority as divine commission.
* Salvation-historical movement from Israel to the Gentiles.
* Christological fulfillment (Resurrection morning; Sun of Righteousness).

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic, exhortational tone addressed implicitly to the believing reader.
* Elevated biblical cadence influenced by Scripture.
* Risk of flattening into neutral historical prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Mandens Mundesord" – the words of the man’s mouth; Hebrew-biblical idiom emphasizing spoken prophetic utterance.
* "Bereder Herrens Vei" – direct echo of Isaiah 40:3; must match KJV diction: “Prepare ye the way of the LORD.”
* "i de sidste Dage" – eschatological phrase; biblical register required.
* "Tidens Fylde" – fullness of time (Gal. 4:4).
* "Jøde først og for Græker" – Romans 1:16; Pauline formula.
* "Retfærdighedens Sol" – Malachi 4:2; traditional christological image.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening contrast between non-writing and writing prophets.
* Lament over lost written testimony from great prophets.
* Divine intention behind written prophecy.
* Historical context: Israel’s hardening and delayed fruit.
* Purpose of written prophecy for future awakening and consolation.
* Inclusion of Gentile empires in God’s redemptive plan.
* Climactic christological fulfillment in Christ’s resurrection and opening of the Scriptures.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Elijah narrative: 1 Kings 17–18; James 5:17–18.
* Transfiguration: Matthew 17.
* John the Baptist: Matthew 11:11; Isaiah 40:3.
* Last days: Joel 2 / Acts 2.
* Sun of Righteousness: Malachi 4:2.
* Burning hearts and opened Scriptures: Luke 24:32, 45.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain lament, wonder, and reverent admiration for prophets.
* Preserve solemn theological interpretation of history.
* Avoid neutral academic tone; keep devotional seriousness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skulde" – rendered as “should” in divine purpose sense.
* "villet" – divine will, not mere preference.
* Necessity and divine intention must remain strong.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Omvendelse – repentance / conversion.
* Naade – grace.
* Ord – Word (capitalized where theological).
* Profeter – Prophets (capitalized when office is stressed).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fruit imagery (repentance, awakening).
* Light/darkness motifs.
* Sun, rays, burning hearts retained as metaphors.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward Israel’s hardening.
* Consolation and hope through Scripture.
* Triumph and joy in Christological fulfillment.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentences with careful punctuation.
* Preserve rhetorical questions and exclamations.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING, SVERDRUP PROFILE)

\subsubsection{Jeremiah’s Book}

In the Old Testament there is told of many Prophets who lived and labored in Israel, yet who have left behind no written record of the spoken word which the Lord sent them forth to bear unto Israel. There is the great prophet of repentance, Elijah—he who contended against the ungodly king, the idolatrous queen, against the priests and prophets of Baal; he who prayed that it might not rain, and it rained not for three years and six months, and he prayed again, and heaven gave rain and the earth yielded her fruit; he who together with Moses met the Savior upon the Mount of Transfiguration—how gladly would we not have had his penitential sermons written down as a testimony for us! There is Elisha, the man of faith, with his unwearied labor for his people; there is John the Baptist, the greatest of those born of women, his voice crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord! What joy would it not have been to possess a book from their own hand, wherein they themselves had set down what the Spirit had given them to testify unto Israel! But the Lord has willed it otherwise.

There are other Prophets, to whom He granted both to speak and to contend—men to whom He Himself revealed what should come to pass in the latter times, and whom He commanded to write down what was revealed to them, as a hope for the future for God’s children under the old Covenant, as admonition and consolation in the faith for us who live in the last days, in the blessed times of fulfillment.

The writing Prophets are all found within a definite period of the history of the people of Israel. And this period is especially that in which Israel more and more hardened its heart against the Word of God, and thus the proclamation of the Prophets did not immediately bear the blessed fruit of repentance in the stiffened people. \textbf{Therefore the Prophets were given command to write down the sermon, that the Word which in the days of the Prophets seemed only to bear the fruit of hardening might, in the Lord’s good pleasure and appointed hour, also bear a rich fruit of awakening and contrition when it was read anew.} At the same time God also caused, in the Gentile world, the mighty kingdoms of the world to arise as instruments of punishment over the obdurate Israel; and the Prophets foretold both their victories and their fall, as a testimony for the Gentiles in the fullness of time, that it was the Lord who gave His people into their hand, and that it was not their great strength and proud power which overcame Israel and Israel’s God. The omnipotence and mercy of God were to shine forth toward the Gentiles in the prophetic Scriptures, when the Lord, through the Gospel of His Son, caused the rays of grace to shine into the darkness of the Gentile world.

Thus it is that precisely in Israel’s darkest hour and in the proudest days of the world-kingdoms the Lord caused His good Word to be richly written down by the holy Prophets, that His faithfulness and truth might appear all the more gloriously—unto the Jew first and also unto the Greek—when the Sun of Righteousness arose for both upon the morning of Christ’s resurrection. Then were the Scriptures to burn within the disciples, when Christ and His Holy Spirit opened the Scriptures unto them.
