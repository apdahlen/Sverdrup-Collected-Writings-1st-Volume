STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "oprykke," "nedrive," "ødelægge," "nedbryde," "bygge," "plante" — verbs drawn directly from Jer. 1:10; must retain biblical cadence and semantic force.
* "Lægedom" — not mere "healing" but restorative divine remedy, often eschatological.
* "Vredesskaalen" — biblical image (cup of wrath); must not be weakened.
* "fyldt sine Synders Maal" — fixed biblical idiom (Gen. 15:16); requires idiomatic rendering.
* "Bodsprædikant" — penitential preacher, not moral reformer.
* "Modsigelsernes Mand" — man marked by contradiction/opposition; echoes Heb. 12:3.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with theological pivots.
* Biblical quotation embedded in prose.
* Sermonic rhythm that resists sentence fragmentation.

Theological Hazards:

* Divine judgment as necessary precondition for healing and life.
* God’s will that the sinner turn and live (Ezek. 18:23).
* Instrumentality of the prophet in divine destruction and restoration.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, weighty Lutheran proclamation.
* Warning and consolation held together without dilution.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "sat over Folkene og Rigerne" — authority of prophetic word, not political power.
* "drikke Vredesskaalen" — Jer. 25 imagery; KJV "drink the cup of my fury."
* "Han ihjelslaar for at levendegjøre" — Deut. 32:39 echo; must preserve paradox.
* "knust deres Hjerter" — penitential breaking, not annihilation.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah’s calling involves both destruction and restoration.
* Judgment is primary because sin is full.
* Divine destruction is medicinal, not final.
* Even the harshest prophet bears a promise of rebuilding.
* Jeremiah’s vocation includes suffering, opposition, and divine protection.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jer. 1:10 — uproot, pull down, destroy, overthrow, build, plant.
* Gen. 15:16 — fullness of sin.
* Jer. 25 — cup of wrath.
* Ezek. 18:23 — God wills not the death of the sinner.
* Deut. 32:39 — killing and making alive.
* Jer. 1:18–19 — fortified city, iron pillar, bronze wall.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain severity of judgment language.
* Preserve consolation without sentimentality.
* Maintain prophetic gravity.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal," "maa" — rendered with strong necessity (shall, must).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Sin, judgment, wrath, grace, healing, life, destruction rendered consistently.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Cup, building/planting, killing/making alive, fortress imagery preserved intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Judgment contrasted with restoration.
* Suffering contrasted with divine refuge.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intended.
* KJV-like cadence maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

In the closest connection with the fact that Jeremiah is thus made the prophet of the nations and of the kingdoms stands the other remarkable feature of Jeremiah’s calling. For he is set over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. It is first and foremost four strong and mighty words of demolition that designate the prophet’s work, and thereafter two words directed toward healing, which express his labor of edification. For the reason that the nations and the kingdoms (among which the people of Israel are also included) are placed under Jeremiah’s prophetic hand lies herein, that they have now filled up the measure of their sins, and therefore must all drink the cup of wrath which the prophet hands them from God. But then it is indeed destruction that stands nearest at the door. God cannot come with His kingdom and His people except where the other kingdoms and peoples are crushed and brought low; and God cannot come with healing and life where there is not sickness and death. He kills in order to make alive. Yet since God wills not the death of any sinner, but that he should turn and live, therefore no prophet is appointed solely to tear down; but even for Jeremiah, who received the heaviest task of all the prophets, even for him it was added that he should build and plant. And as he had to proclaim judgment and ruin both upon Jerusalem and upon Babylon, so he was also granted to bear witness to grace and restoration both for Israel and for its enemies, when the Lord had broken their hearts.

Hereby the prophet Jeremiah was consecrated to be a preacher of repentance, a prophet of peace. But he was also consecrated to be a man of sufferings, a man of contradictions. For he who was to strike down all that upon which Israel relied, and to deprive it of all repose, so that it became poor as a heathen people, he had to endure all the hatred and persecution of those who imagined themselves to be something. Yet in all his suffering and in all persecution he was to have a firm refuge, a citadel of deliverance in distress: the Lord, the God of Israel. Therefore, on the day of his calling, he was given with him that rock‑firm word which could not fail: “And I, behold, I make thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” (Jer. 1:18–19).
