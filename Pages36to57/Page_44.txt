STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Sendelse" – carries theological weight of divine commissioning, not mere mission.
* "Verdens-staden" – more than a large city; implies worldliness and symbolic universality.
* "Forskjæl" – doctrinal term tied to Pauline equality of Jew and Gentile.
* "indesluttet" – Pauline metaphor (Rom. 11:32), not simply "included."
* "Opreisningen" – resurrection/raising/restoration language, not generic comfort.
* "Sønderknuselse" – deep spiritual brokenness under judgment.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, flowing sentences with theological pivots must not be broken down excessively.
* Embedded scriptural quotations woven into prose.
* Parallel constructions contrasting Jew/Gentile, sin/grace, judgment/mercy.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of universal sin and universal offer of mercy.
* Relation between Law, righteousness, and faith in Christ.
* Typological reading of Jonah as sign to Israel.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic, exhortational tone addressing the conscience of Israel.
* Solemn interpretive authority—must not sound academic or detached.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "i Sæk og Aske" – biblical idiom of repentance (cf. Jonah 3; Job 42:6).
* "Nøds Dag" – KJV-style "day of trouble" (Ps. 50:15).
* "lig-baare" – metaphor of national death and mourning, not literal funeral imagery.
* Pauline idioms: "ingen Forskjæl," "alle har syndet," "uden Loven" – clear echoes of Romans.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Introduction: Jonah as the only other prophet sent to Gentiles; comparison to Jeremiah.
* Narrative: Jonah’s reluctant mission and Nineveh’s repentance.
* Doctrinal inference: No distinction between Jew and Gentile under sin.
* Christological revelation: Mystery fulfilled in Christ.
* Warning: Equal sin entails equal judgment.
* Consolation: Equal brokenness leads to equal grace.
* Conclusion: Jeremiah’s calling as prophet over nations grounded in this truth.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jonah 3:4 – explicit quotation.
* Romans 3:23; 3:22; 10:12; 11:32 – strong verbal and conceptual echoes.
* Psalmic language: calling upon the Lord in the day of trouble.
* Jeremiah 1:10 – explicit citation.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain solemn interpretive authority.
* Preserve sharp doctrinal contrasts and warnings.
* Retain pastoral gravity without emotional dilution.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal" – rendered as "shall," not "will" where doctrinal necessity is implied.
* "maa" – preserved as moral or divine necessity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Synd – sin
* Naade – grace
* Dom – judgment
* Retfærdighed – righteousness
* Omvendelse – repentance

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Jonah as sign.
* Nineveh as world-city.
* Jeremiah walking behind the bier of his people.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Judgment vs. mercy.
* Warning vs. hope.
* Mourning vs. calling.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences with internal rhythm.
* Maintain sermonic flow suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

There is only one other Prophet in the Old Testament who was not sent to the Jews, and his sending also is exceedingly wondrous; yet it serves to cast light upon the calling of Jeremiah. This is the Prophet Jonah, who is sent to Nineveh, and who, however unwillingly he goes, must nevertheless at last come thither.

Jonah was sent to the great city, which was the Lord’s instrument of punishment over the kingdom of Israel, with this brief preaching: “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown” (Jonah 3:4). But Nineveh repented in sackcloth and ashes, and God had compassion upon the world-city and allowed it to endure yet a little time. This was the first great sign which the Lord set before His people, whereby He bore witness to them that there is no difference between Jew and Gentile; for all have sinned. Therefore the one stands just as much under God’s judgment as the other. But when the Ninevites repented, then God set His sign of mercy and pointed toward the mystery which is revealed in Christ: that God hath shut up all under sin, that He might have mercy upon all. And there is no difference between Jew and Greek; but apart from the Law the righteousness of God is revealed through faith in Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all that believe.

But the more the Jewish people, by their sin and stubbornness, placed themselves on a level with the Gentiles, the more decisively did the Lord testify to them that they who were equal in sin should become equal in punishment. And all the more clearly did He also make it known among men that they who had become equal in brokenness under God’s judgment, they should become equal in restoration by God’s grace, if they called upon the Lord in their day of distress. Therefore Jeremiah, who in this manner must walk sorrowing behind the funeral-bier of his people, is already in his very calling appointed as prophet over the nations and over the kingdoms (Jer. 1:10).
