STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "aandelig Henseende" – spiritual sense, not merely mental or emotional.
* "Hvilens Tid" – a season of respite, not leisure.
* "Profeten" – titular, weighty; must retain dignity.
* "Mandtro" – covenantal unfaithfulness, not just disloyalty.
* "Afgudsdyrkelse" – idolatry with strong biblical charge.
* "Vægtere" – watchmen in prophetic/biblical sense.
* "Besøgelsestid" – time of divine visitation (Luke 19:44 echo).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, paratactic sentences with sermon cadence.
* Semicolon pivots that carry argument forward.
* Embedded quotations from Scripture-like language.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of prophetic calling and suffering servant motif.
* Divine judgment beginning at the house of God.
* Repentance vs. false security (“Peace, peace”).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone.
* Solemn historical narration blended with direct admonition.
* Address to conscience and pastoral warning.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "sprængt ved Kaldeerne" – broken open by the Chaldeans; historical concreteness.
* "om dog en Sjæl kunde frelses" – Pauline/pietistic urgency (cf. Rom 11:14).
* "Herrens Tempel" refrain – Jeremiah 7; false confidence in externals.
* "Fred! Fred! og ingen Fare" – Jeremiah 6:14; KJV resonance.
* "Staar paa Veiene" – Jeremiah 6:16; preserved nearly verbatim in KJV.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Jeremiah’s imprisonment as spiritual respite.
2. Continued calling after release.
3. Contrast with Ezekiel’s ministry among the exiles.
4. Persistent persecution and rejection.
5. Jeremiah as archetype of the suffering servant.
6. Application: warning to watchmen and dead Christians.
7. Climactic call to repentance before imminent judgment.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah 7 – Temple sermon.
* Jeremiah 6:14, 6:16 – false peace and ancient paths.
* Luke 19:44 – visitation time.
* 1 Peter 4:17 – judgment begins at the house of God.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp warnings.
* Preserve prophetic urgency.
* Avoid softening judgment language.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "vil" and "skal" rendered with strong futurity/necessity.
* Imperatives retained as commands.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Lord = LORD / the Lord.
* Judgment = judgment, not consequence.
* Repentance = turn, return.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Watchmen on Zion’s walls.
* Way/road imagery.
* Stone upon stone.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Narrative → exhortation → warning → final solemn note.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where possible.
* Parallel imperatives preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Thus the prison had, in a spiritual sense, been a season of rest for the Prophet from his struggle with the hard and rebellious people. Yet he was not finished. His imprisonment was indeed broken open by the Chaldeans, and life and freedom were offered him with those who were carried away to Babylon. But Jeremiah chose to remain behind in the devastated Judah and to labor among the wretched remnants of the people, if perchance a soul might be saved. The Lord had sent to the captives another mighty Prophet for awakening and consolation, the Prophet Ezekiel. Jeremiah remained with the scattered people in Judah, over whom the king of Babylon set Gedaliah as governor. But even now he was not permitted to live in peace. Certain robbers, led by Ishmael, slew Gedaliah, and the people fled in terror to Egypt and forced Jeremiah to go with them. There also he continued to bear witness to them that the Lord’s punishment would come upon them for their unfaithfulness and idolatry. His death is unknown, but an ancient tradition says that he was stoned by his own countrymen.

Such is the life of the man who received the heaviest prophetic calling, and who saw Jerusalem’s last days before the exile. No prophet is so much as he a pattern of the suffering servant, who was required to proclaim to the Israel hardened a second time that Jerusalem and the Temple should be laid waste, until there was not one stone left upon another, because it knew not the time of its visitation. But from the life of this man of God there goes forth a crying voice to all who are set as watchmen upon Zion’s walls: Be faithful in the Lord’s work and stand manfully upon your watch; for the Lord will require the blood of His people at the hand of the unfaithful watchmen. And there is a cry of awakening to all dead Christians: Trust not in lying words! Hearken not to priests who cry, “The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are these,” nor to prophets who cry, “Peace! Peace! and no danger.” Turn ye, turn ye! Stand in the Ways and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. Behold, the Way, Jesus Christ, is revealed unto us; God grant that none may harden themselves and say, We will not walk therein. For the Lord’s judgment is near to be revealed, and from the house of God it shall begin.
