STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Frelsesraad” – divine counsel of salvation; must retain covenantal, eternal sense.
* “Syndetrældommen” – bondage/slavery of sin; Pauline resonance.
* “Forskjættelse” – promise in biblical-covenantal sense (not mere prediction).
* “Kald” – vocation/calling with divine authority.
* “Lunkne” – spiritually lukewarm (Rev. 3 echo).
* “Frimodighed” – boldness/confident courage before God.
* “Raadnende Kristenhed” – decaying/apostate Christendom.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with theological pivots.
* Sermonic cadence relying on repetition (“endnu… endnu… endnu…”).
* Embedded Scripture quotations integrated into argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of repentance (“Vender om”).
* Ongoing coming of Christ in hearts (inward advent language).
* Ecclesiology: church’s apparent defeat vs. promised victory.
* Use of Old Testament promises applied christologically.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Prophetic warning blended with consolation.
* Risk of modernizing urgency or softening rebuke.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Værder om, vender om!” – archaic imperative: take heed, repent; prophetic call.
* “Morgenstjernen oprinder i eders Hjerter” – 2 Peter 1:19; KJV diction available.
* “Gaar ikke længer ned i Tørne” – metaphor of ruin/desolation; prophetic imagery.
* “Fortabte Sønner og Døtre” – echo of Luke 15, prodigal son.
* “Hvor Herrens Ord knuser og slaaer” – Law/Gospel dialectic.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: threefold task of prophets.
* Scriptural grounding (2 Peter 1:19).
* Application to the present Church.
* Diagnosis of neglect and spiritual decline.
* Eschatological and missional reminder.
* Purpose statement: encouragement through Jeremiah.
* Concluding Law/Gospel affirmation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Genesis 12 / Abrahamic promise.
* Isaiah 2:2 – mountain of the Lord.

* Revelation 3 – lukewarmness.
* Passion narrative – priests, Herod, Pilate.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain pastoral exhortation and hope.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “burde visselig” – certainly ought.

* Preserve imperatives and necessity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kald – calling.
* Profetiske Ord – prophetic word.
* Menighed – congregation/church.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Light in dark place.
* Morning star.
* Going down into thorns.
* Knocking down and healing word.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning vs. consolation.
* Decline vs. promised victory.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences.
* Keep rhythmic repetition and exhortational flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

There are, then, three things in which the work of the prophets is gathered together.
It is the revelation of God’s counsel of salvation, the final, eternal deliverance from the bondage of sin. Next, it is the preparation of the people to receive the coming Savior. Finally, it is the early and unceasing task of reminding the people of their calling, and again and again to warn: “Take heed, return!”—to all apostate and stubborn children.

“And we have the prophetic word made more sure, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the Day-star arise in your hearts” (2 Peter 1:19). Thus the Apostle Peter exhorts us. And the Christian congregation ought indeed far more diligently to follow this exhortation, and to use the prophetic word for its edification. For it is the promise of Abraham which has now come, and daily comes, to all peoples; it is the hope of Israel which is now being fulfilled from day to day. There is still a coming of Christ in the hearts, for which they are prepared by the Word of the Lord; it is still necessary to cry out: “Turn ye, my fallow ground, and go down no longer into the thorns”; and there is still a holy calling which goes forth to all lost sons and daughters in the whole of humanity: “Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto you!”

But the prophetic word is greatly neglected among us, and thereby we have lost much power and boldness; thereby we have forgotten the great and holy goal which God’s Word has set before us: “Ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.” We have become apathetic and sluggish to spread God’s Word, because we have forgotten the calling—that the Lord wills that through us the Gospel of the Kingdom should be proclaimed in all lands and in all tongues. We have forgotten that “in the last days the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.”

If it might be possible to spur one or another to more diligent use of this blessed Word, and thereby to gain comfort and boldness in these evil days, when the congregation seems destined to perish, because the chief priests and Herod and Pilate have again joined together against it; if it might be possible to strengthen the congregation in its despair unto a final victory over all its enemies; if it might be possible to cry “Repent!” into a rotting Christendom—then we will attempt to give a small glimpse into the life of the prophet Jeremiah and his book. And we believe that if anyone should allow himself to be moved to read and ponder this prophet of sorrow and affliction, he would experience that where the Word of the Lord crushes and smites, there it also raises up and heals.
