STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Kaldelse" as divine calling, not mere vocation.
* "opbygge og plante" echo Jeremiah 1:10; must retain biblical force.
* "Trængselstid" as eschatological/prophetic distress, not generic trouble.
* "Gjenfødelsens Pagt" carries Johannine and prophetic rebirth theology.
* "forbigangent" meaning superseded, not annihilated.
* "overvættes Naade" as superabundant grace.
* "een Vei" covenantal unity language.
* "forstokkede" as hardened (biblical).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with theological pivots.
* Heavy parataxis and semicolon logic.
* Embedded explanatory clauses that must not be flattened.

Theological Hazards:

* New Covenant theology (Jer 31).
* Suffering of the prophet as typological of Christ.
* Divine judgment and purification of God’s own servants.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic gravity and exhortation.
* Direct address to conscience at the end.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "bygge og plante" – Jer 1:10; constructive redemptive action.
* "Fødselsstime" – labor imagery; cf. John 16, Isa 66.
* "een Vei og eet Hjerte" – Jer 32:39.
* "Gud lader sig ikke spotte" – Gal 6:7 echo.
* "prøvet i Ilden" – Mal 3; 1 Pet 1.
* "den lidende Frelser" – Isa 53 typology.
* "anden Grøde" – harvest imagery; eschatological fulfillment.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Jeremiah’s calling includes destruction and restoration.
2. The Book of Consolation (Jer 30–33).
3. New Covenant and reborn people of God.
4. Prophetic sign through purchase of the field.
5. Third section: fulfillment through judgment and suffering.
6. Jeremiah as type of the suffering righteous one.
7. God’s faithfulness in judgment and consolation.
8. Final exhortation to the reader.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah 1:10; 30–33; 32:39; 31:31–34.
* Isaiah 53.
* Galatians 6:7.
* Malachi 3:3.
* 1 Peter 1:7.
* Isaiah 54:1 (barren woman imagery).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings, suffering, and exhortation are retained without softening. The prophet’s tears and God’s judgment are stated with full seriousness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

Necessity and divine certainty ("skal", "maa") rendered with "shall" and "must".

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Pagt – Covenant
* Folk – People
* Trængsel – Tribulation
* Naade – Grace
* Samle – Gather

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

Birth, harvest, fire, vineyard, and tears imagery are preserved intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

Judgment vs. consolation; suffering vs. joy; warning vs. prayerful hope.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long, flowing sentences retained; commas and semicolons preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The prophet’s calling had also set him to build and to plant, and in his book there follows upon the heavy discourses of demolition and crushing a most beautiful Book of Consolation. This is the second section of Israel’s portion, chapters 30–33. The prophet proclaims a great time of tribulation over Jacob; yet he shall be saved out of it. It is so painful, that little while, for it is an hour of birth, and the Lord brings forth for himself a people (chap. 30). The people that are born are the tribes of Israel and Judah, whom the Lord gathers; and when he has gathered them, he establishes with them a new covenant, a covenant of forgiveness of sins and of regeneration, so that the old people has passed away, and behold, there is a new people, born of God (chap. 31). A sure sign of this superabounding grace of the Lord the prophet receives in the prison. In the midst of this siege, which ends with the fall of Jerusalem and the devastation of the land, he is commanded to buy a field, as though there were the deepest peace in the land; thereby the Lord will point forward to the great peace that shall be in the land when he gathers the scattered into one people and gives them one heart and one way (chap. 32). The people that are gathered and born shall be a people in joy and blessedness, an innumerable host of singers and priests unto God (chap. 33).

Finally, chapters 34–45 form the third section of Israel’s portion. Its purpose and content are to show how the Lord fulfills the words of his servant Jeremiah. Jerusalem fell, the temple was burned, the people were carried away, the land became a wilderness. This section is therefore chiefly narrative, with brief prophetic utterances interwoven into the account. Yet not only is this section the Book of Judgment over the hardened people; it is also the Book of Jeremiah’s sufferings. Here we are told in great detail how the people, upon whom the Lord’s punishment fell, in their bitterness turned against the Lord’s messenger and mistreated him in many ways, so that he truly became a foreshadowing of the suffering Savior, who suffered, the righteous for the unrighteous. Thus these chapters are placed here to show that God is not mocked. His threatenings he fulfills, and even over those who are his prophets and messengers he brings the purifying fire of tribulation, that they may come forth as gold tried in the fire and be unto praise and glory and honor at the coming of Jesus Christ. The faithful prophet had to suffer with his people; but God gathered his tears and his pain and caused them to become a harvest of joy, when his time came to comfort his people, to give it double from his hand for all its sins, to gather all its scattered ones and to make the children of the desolate more than hers who had a husband. Jeremiah was the one who more than any other prophet in the old covenant went forth with weeping; now the time has come when another crop of the gray-haired fathers is gathered into the barn. May the Lord grant of his grace that we all might be of this new people of God, with one heart and one way! For us all this is written, for us all this struggle is waged; let us therefore diligently consider also this man of sorrows and his day’s work in the Lord’s vineyard, that we might thereby be strengthened to remain faithful in the suffering that is entrusted to us.
