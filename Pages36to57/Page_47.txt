STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Letsindighed" (light-mindedness, reckless presumption with moral culpability)
* "Stoltheds Volverf" (pride’s entanglement/snare; metaphorical density)
* "Raab" (public cry/proclamation, not mere shouting)
* "Spaadom" (prophetic utterance with divine authority)
* "Kiød for sin Arm" (biblical idiom; human strength as trust)
* "Vredesvin" (wine of wrath; biblical cup imagery)
* "Forhærdelse" (judicial hardening, not mere stubbornness)

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological pivots
* Embedded biblical quotations requiring KJV resonance
* Sermonic rhythm with climactic enumerations

Theological Hazards:

* False prophecy vs. true sending by God
* Repentance (Omvender eder!) as imperative grace
* Divine judgment beginning with God’s own city
* Election without repentance as false security

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical sharpness against false prophets
* Judicial solemnity in announcing judgment
* Earnest exhortation addressed to conscience

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Fred! Fred!" echoes Jer. 6:14; false assurance
* "tale sit eget Hjertes Syn" = self-generated revelation
* "holde Kiød for sin Arm" cf. Jer. 17:5
* Cup of wrath imagery cf. Jer. 25
* Burning of the scroll cf. Jer. 36

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Exposure of false prophets
* Protection of Jeremiah under Josiah
* Political shift after Josiah’s death
* Prophecy of Babylonian judgment
* Universal collapse of false supports
* Escalation of persecution

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah 23:16, 23:32
* Jeremiah 25
* Jeremiah 26:11
* Jeremiah 17:5
* Cup of wrath motif (Jer. 25)

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and condemnations remain unsoftened; prophetic confrontation retained.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skulde" rendered as "should/must"
* Imperatives preserved ("Omvender eder!")

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Profet = Prophet
* Herrens Ord = the word of the LORD
* Omvende = repent/turn

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Mask-ripping imagery retained
* Cup of wrath preserved
* Breaking of supports imagery retained

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Exposure → Judgment → Persecution

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long clauses and sermonic cadence preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Nor did it go any better with the false prophets. The tangled snare of their pride was their reckless cry: Peace! Peace! They gave themselves out to proclaim the truth of God; then came the Prophet of truth, sent by God, and without mercy he tore the mask from their hypocritical face and bore witness to them with the word of the LORD: “Hearken not unto the prophets that prophesy unto you, and make you vain; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD” (Jer. 23:16). “Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their light-mindedness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD” (Jer. 23:32).

Then there arose a bitter hatred against Jeremiah in the hearts of the prophets, because their pride had been broken. And they would not hear the grace of God: Repent ye!

So long, however, as King Josiah lived, Jeremiah was relatively secured against the malice of his enemies. But Josiah fell in the battle at Megiddo; and after Joahaz had reigned three months and, according to Jeremiah’s prophecy, had been carried away to Egypt to die there, then came the wretched reign of Jehoiakim, in whose time the king himself also became the prophet’s enemy. For in his fourth year the prophet delivered that mighty discourse which is written in the twenty-fifth chapter of his book. In that same year Nebuchadnezzar became king in Babylon, and the prophet declared plainly that because Israel for three-and-twenty years had heard the counsel of the LORD through him, early and unceasingly, yet would not turn again, therefore Nebuchadnezzar should come, and Judah and all the surrounding nations should serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.

Then should the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp vanish from Judah, and the land become a desolation and its cities ruins. Then neither should the temple of the LORD avail them who trusted that they were the chosen people of the LORD; nor should alliances with foreign princes avail them who held flesh for their arm; but all supports should break, for the hour of the LORD was come. His cup filled with the wine of wrath was full, and the prophet must now take it and bring it to all the nations upon whom the judgment came. But Jerusalem must drink first; for with His own city would the LORD begin.

Thus Judah was made equal with the heathen. Thirty years of hardening had filled the measure. And then also the embitterment against Jeremiah arose. The priests and the prophets and the people laid hold on him and said: This man is worthy to die, for he hath prophesied against this city (Jer. 26:11). But this time the princes delivered him. And yet in that same year Jeremiah wrote all his prophecies in a book, and it was brought to King Jehoiakim; and he read it, and when three or four leaves had been read, the king took the scribe's knife and cut them asunder and cast them into the fire and burned them. And he commanded that Jeremiah and his faithful scribe Baruch should be seized; but the LORD hid them.

And Jeremiah, who had overthrown both the king’s fleshly policy and his fleshly reliance upon the promise of David’s eternal kingdom, Jeremiah could now number the kings also among his enemies.
