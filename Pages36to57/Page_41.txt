STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "forunderlige" – carries sense of providentially wondrous, not merely strange.
* "Verdensrige" – implies world-empire with theological weight.
* "oversvømmede Juda, indtil det gik lige til Halsen" – metaphorical, biblical imagery (Isa. 8:8).
* "Strafferedskabet" – instrument of divine judgment.
* "gjennemsyret" – fully permeated, saturated.
* "rives som en Brand ud af Ilden" – biblical metaphor (Zech. 3:2).
* "Vækkelse" – revival in a pietistic, spiritual sense.
* "Medfølelse" – here closer to deep contrition or grief of conscience.
* "Stivsind" – obstinate hardness of heart.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with embedded causal clauses.
* Sermonic sequencing of historical narrative → theological interpretation.
* Parallel constructions reinforcing moral contrast.

Theological Hazards:

* Faith vs. unbelief in God’s Word and promise.
* Divine sovereignty using pagan empires as judgment.
* Concept of a remnant.
* Law, covenant, repentance, and judgment.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, prophetic tone must not be historicized away.
* Moral urgency and lament over stubbornness.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "gik lige til Halsen" – evokes near-drowning judgment; cf. Isaiah 8:8 (KJV imagery appropriate).
* "Brand ud af Ilden" – Zechariah 3:2; preservation by sheer mercy.
* "Vaagn op!" – revivalist cry; echoes Eph. 5:14.
* "holde Herrens Lov" – covenantal obedience, not mere legalism.
* "Paaske" – Passover, loaded with redemptive memory.
* "Forgjæves!" – despairing rejection; cf. Jer. 2:25.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Historical framing: Isaiah → Ahaz → Hezekiah.
* Two exemplary contrasts: unbelief (Ahaz) vs. faith (Hezekiah), each with consequences.
* Climactic corruption under Manasseh.
* Mercy preserved in the doctrine of the remnant.
* Josiah as final gracious visitation.
* Ultimate rejection by the people.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Isaiah 7–8 (Ahaz, Assyria, flooding imagery).
* Isaiah 39 (Babylon foretold as instrument).
* Zechariah 3:2 (brand from the fire).
* Jeremiah 11:6 ("Hear the words of this covenant").
* Judges era comparison (Passover).
* Jeremiah 18:12 (stubbornness quote).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain prophetic gravity.
* Retain lamenting yet urgent call to repentance.
* Do not soften the people’s rebellion.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity and inevitability in judgment language.
* Retain firmness of divine declarations.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Law, covenant, judgment, mercy, remnant, repentance rendered consistently.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Flood, fire, awakening, covenant, and path metaphors retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between divine mercy and human obstinacy kept sharp.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The prophet Isaiah lived after the death of Uzziah, under three kings—Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah—and in this period two wondrous events occurred which, by righteous steps, led the people of Israel toward their appointed end.

The first is this: that Ahaz would not believe the word of the Lord nor the help of the Lord against the kingdom of Israel and Syria, who had attacked him (Isa. 7); but instead he entered into alliance with the Assyrian world-empire, which came and destroyed the kingdom of Israel and overflowed Judah, until it reached even unto the neck. The second is this: that Hezekiah believed the help and the word of the Lord against the Assyrians and was delivered from death; yet soon thereafter he drew so near to Babylon in friendship that the Lord proclaimed that Babylon should become the rod of chastisement over Judah.

After Hezekiah followed his son Manasseh, who reigned over Judah for fifty-five years and, during this long reign, brought Judah’s sin to its full measure, so that the people, thoroughly permeated by idolatry favored from above, became utterly corrupted and could no longer be cleansed except through judgment. Yet the mercy of the Lord was not exhausted; for though the people of Judah could not be saved, the remnant of Judah could yet be plucked as a brand out of the fire.

Therefore, even after the death of Manasseh, counseling prophets still went forth to the people; and after the ungodly reign of Amon there came yet a revival under King Josiah.

He was eight years old when he became king, and when he was sixteen years old he began to seek the Lord. He turned himself to God, and since his heart had been made steadfast in the fear of God, he began, at twenty years of age, a reformation in his kingdom—a cleansing from idolatry. He tore down all the images of idols, overthrew their altars, and forbade their sacrifices throughout the realm.

The following year Jeremiah was called to be a prophet, and his mighty revival preaching supported the king’s reformation. Six years passed, and then another remarkable event strengthened still further the cry, “Awake!” to the sleeping people: the Book of the Law was found by the priest Hilkiah. It was brought to the king and read before him, and it filled him with the deepest contrition, because the people were so far from the goal of the Law. Then he assembled all the people and made a covenant with them, that from that time forth they should keep the Law of the Lord.

And Jeremiah went about in Jerusalem and in all the cities of Judah and proclaimed, by the command of the Lord: “Hear the words of this covenant, and do them” (Jer. 11:6). And thereafter Josiah kept the Passover with the whole people—a Passover such as had never been kept since the days of the Judges.

It was a wondrous season of stirring in the kingdom of Judah in the days of Josiah, and the Lord called to His people with a winsome voice: “Turn ye, turn ye from your evil way!” But the people would not. They said, “It is in vain; for we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the stubbornness of his evil heart.”
