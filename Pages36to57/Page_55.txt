STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Bodprædikener" – penitential sermons with strong Lutheran repentance theology, not mere moral exhortations.
* "Forhærdelse" – spiritual hardening, biblically charged (cf. Pharaoh, Rom. 9), not psychological stubbornness.
* "Hjemsøgelsens Dag" – day of visitation/judgment, biblical idiom.
* "egenretfærdige Stolen" – self-righteous reliance, not simple confidence.
* "Forkastet Sølv" – metallurgical biblical metaphor (Jer. 6:30).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, cumulative sentences summarizing large textual units.
* Frequent causal chains (fordi… derfor…).
* Parenthetical Scripture references that must remain intact.

Theological Hazards:

* Repentance (bod), judgment (dom), hardening, covenant infidelity, exile, prophetic symbolism.
* Distinction between warning and irrevocable judgment.

Voice Hazards:

* Survey tone remains sermonic and grave, not neutral academic prose.
* Condemnatory language must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "forladt Kilden med levende Vand" – Jer. 2:13; KJV resonance: “the fountain of living waters.”
* "sprukne Brønde" – “broken cisterns,” standard KJV phrasing.
* "kaldes forkastet Sølv" – prophetic verdict formula.
* "Hinnoms Søns Dal" – Valley of the Son of Hinnom, site of idolatry and judgment.
* Potter metaphor (Lerskrukke / Potterkar) – Jer. 19; Rom. 9 echoes.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Call narrative (ch. 1)
* Series of escalating penitential sermons (chs. 2–6)
* Temple Sermon (chs. 7–10)
* Symbolic and verbal warnings intensifying toward inevitability (chs. 11–19)
* Judgments against leaders (chs. 20–23)
* Finalization of judgment and exile (chs. 24–29)
* Structural summary contrasting exhortation vs. irrevocable decree

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah 2:13; 6:30; 7:2–4; 8:3; 19; 23; 25; 29
* Shepherd imagery and Messianic promise (David’s righteous Branch – Jer. 23:5)

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain severity of judgment language.
* Preserve imagery of destruction and helplessness.
* Keep prophetic finality intact.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and inevitability rendered with “shall,” not “will” where appropriate.
* Prohibitions and divine refusals kept absolute.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Bod – repentance
* Dom – judgment
* Forhærdelse – hardening
* Forkastet – rejected

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain water, metal, pottery, storm-cloud imagery.
* No explanatory dilution.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Darkness dominates, with brief but vivid messianic light in ch. 23.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained.
* Semicolons and rhythmic clauses preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

In these first twenty-nine chapters there is first related the calling of the Prophet in chapter 1. Thereupon begins the great series of crushing penitential sermons, in which here and there flashes a glimpse of hardening forth between the heavy, dark storm-clouds. Judah is punished in chapter 2, because it has exchanged the LORD for idols, because it has forsaken the fountain of living waters and hewn out for itself broken cisterns that can hold no water. Chapters 3–6 are a mighty sermon against the pride of Judah, which exalted itself above its sister, the kingdom of Israel. Judah has seen Israel’s fate and punishment, yet has not repented; therefore its punishment shall be the heavier. Priests and prophets and princes, who have strengthened the people in its sin upon the brink of the abyss, shall be utterly helpless in the day of visitation, and the whole people shall be called rejected silver; for the LORD has rejected them (6:30).

Then follows in chapters 7–10 the great Temple Sermon, so called from 7:2 and 4. The self-righteous reliance upon the Temple is altogether in vain; and because it only hardens the heart of the people, therefore such judgment shall come upon them that death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil generation (8:3). Thereupon follows discourse upon discourse, in which Israel is exhorted to repentance and threatened with destruction, now by words, now by symbolic actions. Israel is set on a level with the heathen in punishment, and the Prophet is not permitted to pray for them; and ever harder sounds the judgment, until the Prophet in chapter 19 receives command to go, buy a potter’s earthen flask, take it with him down into the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, defiled with idolatry, and there break it in the sight of the people as a sign that thus shall Israel’s people also be broken and become utterly useless, like a warped vessel of the potter, because it has hardened its neck.

In chapters 20–24 the overthrow turns itself more toward individual prominent persons. In chapter 20 judgment is pronounced upon Pashhur, who mistreated the Prophet; in chapters 21 and 22 upon the wicked kings; in chapter 23 upon the evil shepherds, and especially the false prophets; yet here also a glorious light breaks forth in the midst of the darkness in the promise of the good Shepherd, David’s righteous Branch. In chapter 24 the judgment is directed against those left behind in Jerusalem after the removal of Jehoiakim, the bad figs that cannot be eaten. In chapter 25 the measure of hardening is full; there the seventy-year exile is proclaimed. And in chapter 26 the Prophet shows that the LORD’s Temple will not shield Israel from judgment; for it too shall be broken down. Nor can Zedekiah’s alliance with the heathen princes stay the judgment (chapters 27 and 28). Finally, those already carried away shall not expect any speedy return from Babylon; therefore the Prophet sends them a letter, that they should with patience be content in the foreign land until the LORD’s time comes to bring them back (chapter 29).

This Book of divine judgment is, in chapters 1–24, chiefly a book of penitential preaching, whereas chapters 25–29 are a definite proclamation of a judgment that is unavoidable, and whose time and hour are already revealed, in that at the same time the last grounds of comfort, to which the hardened people clung, are torn away without any sparing.
