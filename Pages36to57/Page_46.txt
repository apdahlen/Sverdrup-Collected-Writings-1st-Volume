* Kald – vocational divine calling, not mere profession.
* efter Kjødet – Pauline/biblical sense: according to human weakness, not fleshly sin.
* nedbryde – spiritual/judicial demolition, not physical destruction.
* Bolværker – metaphorical fortresses of false security.
* Trøstegrund – ground/basis of consolation, especially false assurance.

* Guds Dom / Vredesdom – judicial wrath, not generic misfortune.
* Temple theology: false trust in external worship.

Voice Hazards:

* Prophetic rebuke directed to conscience.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "stærk i Herrens Kraft" echoes biblical paradox of weakness and divine strength (cf. 2 Cor. 12).
* "Fred! Fred!" alludes to false prophetic reassurance (Jer. 6:14; 8:11).
* "Herrens Tempel" refrain mirrors Jeremiah 7:4; must retain liturgical chant quality.
* "Røverhule" directly echoes Jeremiah 7:11; KJV diction appropriate.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Introduction of the prophet’s weakness vs. divine power.
* Identification of Judah’s false security.
* Comparison with fallen Israel to expose doubled guilt.
* Exposure of priestly and prophetic corruption.
* Climactic prophetic confrontation at the temple gate.
* Resulting enmity and rejection of the call to repentance.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Jeremiah 1 – calling to uproot and tear down.
* Jeremiah 5:31 – false prophets and compliant priests.
* Jeremiah 7 – Temple Sermon.
* Shiloh reference (1 Sam. 4; Jer. 7:12–14).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and rebukes remain sharp and unsoftened.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* skulde – rendered as strong divine necessity (“was to”).
* kan vi ikke gaa tilgrunde – categorical false assurance.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Omvendelse – repentance.
* Dom – judgment.
* Huus – House (Temple of the LORD).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Hammer, fortresses, robbery-den imagery retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From historical narration to prophetic denunciation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved; proclamatory rhythm maintained.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

Thus the Prophet went forth in his calling, frail, gentle, and fearful according to the flesh, yet strong in the power of the Lord. He was appointed to tear down peoples and kingdoms by his word. He was to proclaim unto them the crushing judgments of God and to be a witness to their fulfillment; but above all he was to overthrow the mighty fortresses which his own people had set between themselves and their God through the stubbornness of their own hearts and their trust in false and insidious words.

We have already said that Israel, under the reign of Josiah, passed through a remarkable season of agitation, and the Prophet labored with burning zeal in that time. The first false ground of consolation against which he lifted the hammer of the Word was Judah’s confidence that it had survived the kingdom of Israel, which had fallen before the power of Assyria. Judah believed itself more secure than her sister Israel; but the Prophet tore away this deceitful comfort and declared that the kingdom of Judah had doubled her sin, for Judah beheld her sister’s fate, and yet did not repent. This was to wound Judah’s pride at its most tender point; for Judah had imagined that Israel had fallen because she had attacked Judah, and it was commonly believed in Judah that her own sin was still less than that of her sister. Therefore the people were embittered against the Prophet, who spoke so freely the word of God, and they would not listen to the man who called them to repentance.

The priests had gained much outwardly through Josiah’s reformation. Their position was strengthened and honored, and the service of the temple was restored; but their hearts were little bowed. For thus Jeremiah bears witness concerning them: “The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule at their direction; and my people love to have it so” (Jer. 5:31). This brief saying opens for us a deep insight into the true condition of things. The prophets proclaimed, Peace! Peace! and healed the hurt of the daughters of Israel lightly; for there was no peace, but the judgment of God’s wrath. And the priests took advantage of the prophets’ reckless doctrine of consolation. They confirmed the false prophecy with the lying word: “The temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD are these” (Jer. 7:4). As though they would say to the people: So long as the temple is in our midst, we cannot perish; make your gifts great and your sacrifices many, and it shall go well with you.

Then the Prophet arose in burning zeal, and, according to the word of the LORD, stood in the gate of His house and cried out to all Judah: “Trust ye not in lying words. This house have ye made a den of robbers; and behold, as Shiloh, where I dwelt, which is now desolate and forsaken, so shall my house become.” From that day the priests, whose heart’s pride was the temple, became Jeremiah’s enemies; for he had torn down their stronghold. And they would not hear the call of the LORD: Repent ye.
