STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Veiledning" – not merely guidance but pastoral instruction.
* "nidkjære" – zealous in a religious, pietistic sense.
* "hidsætte" – to append or add deliberately.
* "inderligt fortrolige" – deeply, inwardly familiar, not merely acquainted.
* "oplade Skrifterne" – open up/unseal the Scriptures, not just read.
* "Vederkvægelse" – spiritual refreshment, consolation.
* "Trældom" – bondage, captivity with theological overtones.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with multiple subordinate clauses.
* Sermonic cadence with parallel destructions.
* Use of dashes to mark rhetorical expansion.

Theological Hazards:

* Concepts of election, false security, repentance, judgment.
* Prophetic vocation: tearing down before building up.
* Temple, Davidic promise, and exile as covenantal realities.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone addressed to believing readers.
* Risk of flattening prophetic severity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "den grønne Eng" / "Hvilens Vande" – Psalm 23 imagery.
* "Flodens Bække, som glæder Guds Stad" – Psalm 46:4.
* "Fred! Fred! og ingen Fare!" – Jeremiah 6:14 echo.
* "Herrens Tempel" – Jeremiah 7 temple sermon.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Reason for commentary: scope of Israel section.
* Diagnosis of poor Bible reading habits.
* Call to deeper, Spirit-led reading.
* Structural outline of Jeremiah 1–45.
* Focus on first section as prophetic demolition.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Psalm 23 (green pastures, still waters).
* Psalm 46 (river that makes glad the city of God).
* Jeremiah 1:10 (pluck up and break down).
* Jeremiah 6–7 (false peace, temple trust).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and judgments must remain severe and uncompromised.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

"skulde" must remain "should" / "was to" in prophetic necessity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Ordet – the Word
* Nedbrydelse – demolition / tearing down
* Omvende sig – repent / turn

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

Agricultural and architectural metaphors retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

Pastoral concern contrasted with prophetic severity.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long sentences preserved where intentional.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

The portion of the Book that concerns Israel, chapters 1–45, is, however, so extensive that in this Guide for believing and zealous readers of the Bible we shall yet append a few additional remarks concerning it, which we hope may assist one or another in his labour with the precious Word of God. Alas, only far too few are truly inwardly familiar with their Bible; and even those who by the grace of God have found life and salvation in the Word are only too often accustomed to read the Scriptures as though they were nothing more than a collection of detached verses, having little true connection one with another. All the more important, therefore, is it—by the help of the Spirit of God—to attempt to open up the Scriptures, if perhaps someone might be led ever further in upon the green pastures, and find refreshment by the waters of rest, even from the streams of the river that make glad the city of God.

There are three sections in the portion of the Book that concerns Israel: chapters 1–29, 30–33, and 34–45. The prophet’s first calling was to pluck up and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow by his mighty prophetic word. He was to strike down all the false supports upon which Israel relied; he was to tear away from them everything upon which they built their fleshly security—both their confident trust in election and their priests’ vain cry of the temple of the Lord; both the prophets’ shouting, “Peace! Peace! and no danger!” and the kings’ fleshly confidence in the promise made to David. By the Word he was to seek to bend the heart of the people into brokenness before the Lord, if only they might repent. But if this should not succeed, then he was in his word to declare to them that the people would be uprooted from their land and carried away to their enemies in bondage; that the land would be laid waste until it became a wilderness; that the temple would be torn down and burned with fire; that the king would be cast down from David’s throne and have no son to inherit the power. This prophetic demolition by the Word Jeremiah sets before us in the first section of the Book concerning Israel, chapters 1–29, which we may call the Book of Demolition.
