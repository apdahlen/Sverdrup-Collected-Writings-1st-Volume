STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Bekjendelse" (confession) as ecclesial confession, not mere admission.
* "een" meaning one/unity, not numeral emphasis.
* "Legeme" as Pauline body-of-Christ theology.
* "Bruden" ecclesiological bridal metaphor.
* "Statholder" as vicar/representative with theological weight.
* "ufeilbar" tied to papal infallibility doctrine.
* "Skin af Sandhed" meaning semblance/appearance of truth.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with layered causal clauses.
* Semicolon logic guiding argument pivots.
* Rhetorical concessions followed by refutations.
* Embedded theological definitions within polemic.

Theological Hazards:

* Unity of the Church as communion with Christ.
* Visible vs. invisible church distinction.
* Mediation of grace and life-union (Livsenhed).
* Critique of papal and episcopal claims.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical Lutheran earnestness.
* Exhortational certainty without sarcasm.
* Maintaining gravity while dismantling opposing claims.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kristi Legeme" – Pauline (1 Cor. 12; Eph. 1), best rendered literally.
* "Kristus er ikke delt" – echo of 1 Cor. 1:13 (KJV resonance).
* "have Del i Kristus" – participation/communion language (John 15).
* "Skin af Sandhed" – KJV-style "appearance of truth."

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Universal confession: the Church is one.
* Agreement on principle: Christ undivided.
* Dispute arises over the nature of unity.
* Visible markers falsely claimed as essence of unity.
* Roman Catholic claim examined first.
* Initial concession: apparent plausibility.
* Core error identified: making invisible unity visible.
* Logical collapse of papal unity claim.
* Extension of critique to episcopal unity.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Corinthians 1:13 – Christ not divided.
* Ephesians 1:22–23 – Christ as Head of the body.
* John 15 – life-union with Christ.
* Ephesians 5 – Bride imagery.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firm refutation.
* Preserve solemn, reasoned polemic.
* Avoid ironic or modern dismissiveness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan der ingen Tvil være" → "there can be no doubt."
* "maa" rendered as must.
* Logical necessity kept absolute.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Church
* Unity
* Body
* Head
* Life-union
* Visible / invisible

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body and Head imagery retained.
* Bride imagery preserved.
* Binding-head metaphor maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Calm agreement → sharp critique.
* Apparent plausibility → decisive rejection.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where intentional.
* Clause rhythm maintained for sermonic flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

It has been the confession of the Church through all ages and in all its divisions, and in every place where it has come under the governance of the Lord, that the Church is one. And it is indeed self‑evident that, if it is the body of Christ, then there can be no doubt that it is a unity. Nor is it here that the dispute hinges; for all parties confess with one mouth that Christ is not divided, and His body just as little. But when we go a step further, we immediately encounter a swarm of contradictions to the simple truth. For if we ask wherein this unity consists, we receive a multiplicity of answers which, by their mutual disagreement, show only that here each of the ecclesiastical communities appears with its own party interest and seeks to usurp what belongs to the whole Church—namely, to be the Body, to be the Bride.

We find a multitude of visible things set forth as that in which the unity properly consists; and each of these visible things is recognized by a particular church body and brought forward in order that it may be made evident that precisely this particular community possesses the true unity, is in truth the body of Christ. And closely bound up with this is the conclusion that all other communities have no right to exist alongside the Body, but must hasten to relinquish their independence and become parts of the one community which, because it is the Body, has the sole right to exist.

Here we first encounter the Roman Catholic Church, whose claim to be the true body of Christ and to possess the right unity seems to many so crude and palpably false that it appears scarcely worth the trouble to examine it. And yet in reality it is the only one that has some semblance of truth with which it may adorn itself. And if we succeed in showing its falsity, then the labor of dealing with other claims concerning the unity of Christ’s Church will be easy.

The Roman Catholic Church maintains with unshakable definiteness that the unity of the Church is precisely its unity with the Head, Christ, and in this claim it has the clearest possible right. But this unity with the Church’s invisible Head is mediated through Christ’s visible vicar upon earth, whom He Himself has appointed and upon whom He has built His Church. And therefore the unity has become a visible unity. It is the infallible Pope who in reality is the Church’s unity, and the entire visible community which acknowledges him and receives all truth and all the gifts of God’s grace from him is precisely the body of Christ. And every other community is outside the Body because it stands outside connection with the earthly head of the Body, infallibility in Rome.

This entire collection of claims would be utterly impossible if there had not been committed a breach with the presupposition that was indeed correct. The Church’s unity as its unity with the Pope is substituted for the real bodily unity with the invisible Christ. The error here lies in this, that one makes into an outward thing what in itself must be invisible and inward. Even if the Pope were ever so much Christ’s vicar upon earth, he could nevertheless never be the unity of the Body; for then it would at least have to be absolutely certain that he himself belonged to the Body. But now we all know that neither papal throne nor papal crown can secure to anyone that he is a member of Christ’s Body, still less that he should be a nexus of unity.

Thus it avails nothing that the Pope be ever so infallible; for no infallibility can secure him that he has any share in Christ. But if it is not even with absolute certainty infallibly sure concerning the Pope himself that he has a share in Christ, then it is still less certain that those who have a share in the Pope have a share in Christ. And thus it becomes altogether impossible that the community which stands in dependence upon the Pope can be Christ’s true Body and His rightful Bride; for no one can assert that this community, through the Pope, has any life‑union with Christ.

We see, therefore, that the claim that a single man is the Church’s unity is a manifest error, a breach with the correct premise upon which all knowledge of the Church’s unity stands or falls. But no less false is it to make an estate, or rather the unity of an estate—for example, the episcopate—the Church’s unity; for even if one were to take together all the bishops of the world, nothing would thereby be demonstrated, that their office were Christ’s office, or that there were any sort of connection whatsoever between them and the Head, Christ. It is once again the same error as before; for once more one seeks to make the invisible, to some degree, visible.
