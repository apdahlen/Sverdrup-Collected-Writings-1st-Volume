STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Anlæg" — denotes innate dispositions, gifts, or spiritual endowments; must not be flattened to mere "talents." Carries anthropological and theological weight.
* "Opgave" — not merely a task, but a divinely grounded vocation or ecclesial calling.
* "Kirkesamfund" — must be rendered consistently as an ecclesial body or church community, not a casual association.
* "Ensīdighede" — one-sidedness, imbalance, reduction; theological narrowing rather than simple specialization.
* "Lem" — Pauline term (member of the body); must retain biblical resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extremely long sentences with layered concessions and rebuttals.
* Dialectical structure with "paa den ene Side / paa den anden Side" requiring balance.
* Heavy use of semicolons and causal chains that should not be broken into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as the Body of Christ.
* Relation between sin and ecclesial development.
* Concept of vocation as community-forming rather than individualistic.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical yet sober tone.
* Academic-sermonic cadence.
* Risk of modernizing into sociological language and losing doctrinal gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "staar for sig alene" — idiom meaning standing isolated; echoes fears of radical individualism.
* "Kirken opløses i Individer" — metaphor of dissolution, not literal destruction.
* Pauline body imagery (1 Corinthians 12) implicit throughout.
* KJV equivalents: "member," "body," "cannot say," etc.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Presentation of two common objections.
* Rebuttal of first objection through historical necessity.
* Rebuttal of second objection through ecclesiology.
* Positive restatement of the principle with defined limits.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Body of Christ imagery (1 Cor. 12; Rom. 12).
* Sin affecting even the Church’s historical development (implicit Romans anthropology).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness in rebuttal.
* Preserve critical engagement with objections.
* Avoid conciliatory or speculative tone.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa," "kan ikke," "vil med Nødvendighed" — rendered as "must," "cannot," "with necessity."

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Opgave = vocation/task consistently.
* Anlæg = disposition/endowment consistently.
* Samfund = community/body consistently.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Division, dissolution, narrowing, development — preserved as dynamic metaphors.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Analytical severity vs. doctrinal clarification.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically necessary.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

One will naturally object here that this line of thought either does not go far enough, or that it goes far too far. On the one hand, it will be said that the various tasks which correspond to the peculiar dispositions can very well find room within the same church community, and indeed must find room there, since every church community consists of a multitude of individuals, each with his different dispositions; and thus the different tasks do not require different communities. On the other hand, it will be said that if it is true that every task and every new disposition requires a new church community, then one cannot stop until one has arrived at the conclusion that every human being stands alone by himself. Only then would the demand of the proposition cease, that the division of the Church is grounded in difference of task and disposition.

But neither of these assertions is a necessary consequence of our principle; or rather, both of these inferences will of necessity be refuted by the Church’s own development. For as regards the first, that a single church community can contain within itself all different tasks and satisfy all dispositions, this is true to a certain degree, and precisely so much nearer to the truth as this single church community approaches the true essence of Christ’s Church. Yet in reality, every church community, however all-embracing it may appear in its beginning, will unavoidably, in the course of its further development, be drawn more and more into one-sidedness. And the longer this endures, the more intolerable the narrowing of the task will become, and the less room there will be for labor on behalf of the other tasks. And development will, according to all that history has yet disclosed, end in a breach within the church community, and one has precisely that division which one thought might be avoided.

Our principle, which requires that the different tasks may ground different communities, is at once grounded in the necessity that all sides of the Christian life be developed to the greatest possible clarity, and in the impossibility that this can take place within a single community—an impossibility which history has demonstrated not once, but many times—an impossibility which indeed would not exist, were it not that sin also plays a role in the Church’s development toward one-sidedness.

And as to the other side of the assertion, that our principle carries too far, until it dissolves the Church into individuals, inasmuch as each human being must be a church community for himself, since he has his own peculiar task and his own peculiar dispositions, it is quite true that every Christian individually is a member of Christ’s body, and according to his peculiar dispositions has his peculiar task. But if one wishes to draw the conclusion: therefore each is a church community for himself, one has leapt over the fact that the essence of the Church is, of necessity, community, and that it is therefore a false inference that because the Church divides itself into communities according to task and disposition, it must therefore divide itself into individuals. One then forgets that an ecclesial task, in order to be carried out, precisely requires a community; and if a task shows itself not to be community-forming, then it thereby shows itself not to be any ecclesial task at all.

Our principle leads with necessity to the division of the Church into ecclesial communities, but it cannot lead further; for the work that is to be done is communal work and can in no wise be performed by individuals alone.
