STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Opfattelse" – carries philosophical-theological sense of apprehension or conception, not mere opinion.
* "Kampen" – denotes spiritual-doctrinal struggle, not physical conflict.
* "Udryddelseskrig" – annihilating war; metaphorically total suppression.
* "Sandheden" – objective divine truth, not subjective truth-claims.
* "Synden indenfor Kirken" – doctrinal assertion of sin within the visible church.
* "Ensidighed" – one-sidedness with theological consequences.
* "Vildfarelse" – heresy or doctrinal error, not simple mistake.
* "Antikristelig Retning" – direction or tendency aligned with Antichrist, heavy eschatological weight.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with cumulative clauses and semicolon logic.
* Progressive argument embedded within sentence chains.
* Parallel constructions that must be preserved for rhetorical force.
* Conditional clauses that escalate warning gradually.

Theological Hazards:

* Nature of truth as multifaceted in Christ.
* Doctrine of ecclesial sin and fallibility.
* Concept of Antichrist as operative principle, not merely individual.
* Tension between love, truth, and partisan spirit.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, solemn Lutheran sermonic tone.
* Appeals to conscience and warning against spiritual danger.
* Moral urgency must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "fatet en enkelt Side af Kristi Sandhed" – grasping one aspect of Christ’s truth; echoes 1 Cor. 13:9 (knowing in part).
* "den ganske Verden kunde vindes" – Matt. 16:26 allusion.
* "Antikristens Gjerning" – echoes 1 John 2:18; work or operation of Antichrist.
* "Kjærlighedens trange Vei" – narrow way imagery from Matt. 7:14.
* "haarsbred" – hair’s breadth; idiom for smallest measure.

Literal rendering would obscure biblical resonance if modernized.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Proper understanding of ecclesial conflict makes struggle necessary and justified.
* Clarification: Conflict is not annihilation but mutual defense of truth’s facets.
* Introduction of new factor: sin within the Church.
* Development: One-sided grasp of truth leads to overvaluation and error.
* Warning: Without corrective development, communities risk Antichristian deviation.
* Function of conflict: mutual sharpening and preservation of truth.
* Balance: Conflict preserves truth and love when rightly ordered.
* Conclusion: True path lies between indifference and bitter annihilation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Corinthians 13:9–12 – knowing in part.
* Matthew 16:26 – gaining the world at the cost of truth/soul.
* Matthew 7:14 – the narrow way.
* 1 John 2:18 – Antichrist already at work.
* Ephesians 6 – spiritual struggle imagery.

KJV diction should be echoed where possible.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain strong warnings about error and Antichrist.
* Preserve earnest exhortation without sentimentality.
* Maintain seriousness regarding truth and love.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal," "maa," "kan ikke" rendered with full necessity (must, cannot, shall).
* Avoid weakening inevitability of consequences.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Sandhed – Truth
* Vildfarelse – Error / Delusion (consistently)
* Antikristens Gjerning – the work of Antichrist
* Kamp – struggle
* Kjærlighed – love (agape sense)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Warfare imagery retained metaphorically.
* Narrow way imagery preserved.
* Light imagery (“shines clearer”) preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in warnings.
* Consolation in proper function of struggle.
* Hope in preservation of truth.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Semicolon pivots retained.
* Clause rhythm maintained for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

And it is this understanding of the relation that alone makes the struggle possible, and makes it not only justified, but altogether necessary. It is not a war of extermination that is to be waged between community and community within the Church, but a struggle to uphold, each on its own side, a portion of the Truth. 

And here we take up a new moment, which earlier we could to a certain degree leave out of consideration: sin within the Church. When an ecclesial community has grasped a single side of the truth of Christ, it soon becomes an impossibility for it to acknowledge that it has not grasped the whole. The opposition to the other communities and the zeal for its own cause drive it to an overvaluation of its own task; and, driven ever further and further from a good beginning out into the one-sidedness that already lay there from the point of departure, it is narrowed more and more, and it cannot be otherwise than that the one-sidedness reveals itself ever more clearly, until the distortion that lay in the beginning becomes more prominent than the truth that lay therein. And if no particular development leads the individual community onto a new path, then there is a high degree of danger that the course which began well will end in grievous delusions and in the manifestation of an antichristian direction. 

But it is under this development, to which any community whatsoever is exposed, that the struggle comes into its fullest right. It is in this course that the one community asserts its apprehension of the truth over against the other. The one-sidedness with which each holds fast to its own—and must hold fast to its own—brings each side of the truth forth in its sharpest light, and the keenest weapons are wielded by practiced hands; and the Truth suffers not, for its light shines only so much the more clearly, the more boldly its various moments are set forth; and Love suffers not, for the struggle is, in the all-guiding hand of the Lord, the means by which the work of Antichrist is checked and hindered wherever love for the Truth is still greater than party-spirit and the desire for one’s own honor, and it is the means by which the work of Antichrist is made manifest even to the simplest, there where love for the Truth has already become weaker than the craving for power. 

Thus it is no ungodliness when a struggle is waged upon the ground of the Truth; it is a necessary means for the Church’s growth in the knowledge of the Truth, and we should neither wish nor even pray that the struggle, so long as it is waged in this manner, might cease, while the Church is still upon the earth and knowledge is in part. If the struggle ceases, it is a sign that the seriousness of truth-knowledge is diminishing; but if the struggle degenerates into bitterness and suffocation, into a war of extermination of community against community, then it is a sign that seriousness has ebbed away into party inclination and carnal desire. But midway between these two extremes lies love’s narrow way, which so few find: on the one hand, to esteem the Truth higher than all and not to surrender even a hair’s breadth of the truth that has been recognized, even if, in appearance, the whole world might thereby be gained; and on the other hand, not to hold fast even a hair’s breadth of a recognized error, though all one’s own honor should be lost by letting the error go.

Just as the division of the Church into many communities does not abolish its unity, which is the unity of life with the Lord, so the recognition of the right of the individual communities to exist does not abolish the superiority of the one community over the other, and the common ground of truth does not abolish the mutual struggle.\footnote{What follows the author himself designated as “historical illumination.” — Ed.}
