STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Samfund" used ecclesiologically (church body/communion), not generic society.
* "Bekjendelse" as confessional commitment (creedal identity), not mere opinion.
* "Erkjendelse" as spiritually informed knowledge/recognition.
* "Ligegyldighed" as doctrinal indifference.
* "Trivsel" as flourishing under God, not mere growth.
* "Opgave" as divinely given task or vocation.
* "Grundsandhed" as governing foundational truth of Scripture.
* "eiendommelig" as distinctive/peculiar, not odd.
* "Sacramenter" with Lutheran sacramental theology implied.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long periodic sentences with conditional chains.
* Rhetorical questions driving argument.
* Semicolon logic that must be preserved.
* Parallel constructions contrasting error vs truth.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as Christ’s Body.
* Degrees of truth-recognition without denying salvation.
* Sacraments as marks of the Church.
* Danger of relativism vs necessity of confessional struggle.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational polemic tone must not be softened.
* Judicial language (judgment, denial of truth).
* Earnest Lutheran sermonic cadence.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kristi Legeme" — Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12), KJV resonance.
* "Sandhedens Vei" — the way of truth (Ps. 119; John 14:6 echo).
* "griber en Side" — lays hold of an aspect; metaphor of grasping truth.
* "tale" of history — personification common in sermons.
* "fuldt forvisset i sit eget Sind" — Romans 14:5 echo; conscience-bound faith.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Raises objection: plurality implies indifference?
* Series of rhetorical questions pressing the issue.
* Firm negative answer.
* Thesis: struggle is necessary; indifference illegitimate.
* Ground: differing tasks and depths of grasping Christ.
* Historical corroboration promised.
* Conclusion: not all communions equal, yet salvation not denied to sincere believers.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Body of Christ — 1 Cor. 12; Eph. 4.
* Fullness of Christ — Eph. 3:19; Col. 1:19.
* Word and Sacraments — Lutheran marks of the Church.
* Being fully persuaded — Rom. 14:5.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp rejection of relativism.
* Preserve judicial condemnation of indifference.
* Maintain earnest, admonitory tone.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa," "skal" rendered as must/shall, not may.
* Necessity of struggle clearly expressed.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Samfund → communion/church body.
* Erkjendelse → knowledge/recognition.
* Sandhed → truth.
* Frelse → salvation.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Grasping truth.
* Depth vs shallowness in knowledge.
* History speaking.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward error.
* Charity toward sincere believers.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved.
* Rhetorical flow maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

But now new questions arise, which seem altogether to demand the completion of all that we have previously recognized. If it be so that no single church body alone has the right to call itself the Body of Christ; if there are many church bodies that may lay claim to being Christian—are we then to understand this in such a way that all communions are equally good, that it becomes wholly a matter of indifference to which communion I belong, and that all the strife which is carried on between church and church is sheer absurdity?

Is it sheer folly when the Lutheran Church contends against the Catholic, and the Reformed Church contends against the Lutheran? Are we henceforth to be entirely at ease, to let each church body labor for itself, and to make no effort to uphold our confession and to set forth what advantages we possess over other communions?

We answer with a definite No to all these questions. There is nothing in our earlier development that affords them any support; and we shall show that indifference has no right within God’s Church, and that the struggle between the contending communions is just as necessary for the Church of God’s flourishing and for its future course along the path of the knowledge of truth, as it is necessary that one communion, so far as the truth allows it, acknowledge the other’s right to exist.

For if it is indeed the case that the division of the Church rests upon a diversity of tasks; if each communion lays hold of a side of the knowledge of Christ, which is nothing other than a distinctive side of that fullness of the knowledge of Christ which is laid up in Holy Scripture; and if each communion has the work of setting forth a branch of the life of Christ—then it is already certain in advance that among the various communions there will be a high degree of difference, according as it is given them to draw near to what is central in the knowledge of Christ.

History will also in the clearest manner establish this for us; and later we shall let it speak. There will be a clear and definite difference between the communions, according as, in the exceeding riches of Holy Scripture, they are able to appropriate that which is the all-governing and all-penetrating fundamental truth of the Word of God, or whether they lay hold only of a side of this fundamental truth, which stands in nearer or more distant connection with it. One communion may penetrate more deeply into the truth than another; and it is precisely this which makes it a contempt for all seriousness and a mockery of the truth to suppose that all communions are equally good, and that it is a matter of indifference whether I belong to the one or to the other.

It is true that every communion with the Word of Christ and the Sacraments, and with its distinctive task to contend for, has the right to exist; but it is a manifest error if one would from this conclude: therefore the one is just as good as the other. And there are cases in which it becomes an open denial of the truth to leave a communion that has a deeper knowledge of Christ’s saving truth, in order to give oneself over to another that in this respect is less advanced.

Yet so long as a Christian, in the sincerity of his heart and fully persuaded in his own mind, stands within a church communion—be it a much or a little erring communion—so long has no one the right to deny him participation in Christ’s salvation and in eternal blessedness, however severe the judgment may sound upon the communion to which he belongs. By this we have not leveled the difference that exists between the communions; we have only made it possible for that difference to be acknowledged in its proper worth. For the difference is not this, that one church communion alone is Christ’s Church and the other is wholly outside the Body of Christ; but the difference is this, that the one may have laid hold more deeply of the knowledge of Christ than the other.
