STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Legemes Enhed" – doctrinal term (unity of Christ’s body), not mere organizational unity.
* "Kirkesamfund" – ecclesial body/denomination; avoid modern sociological flattening.
* "rene Lære" – pure doctrine; must retain confessional and polemical weight.
* "Forbindelse" – communion/connection with Christ; more than association.
* "Kjendetegn" – mark or note of the Church; echoes notae ecclesiae.
* "Forførernes Magt" – power of deceivers; moral-spiritual force.
* "Tryghed" – false security, not mere comfort.
* "Forfængelig" – vainly/taking in vain; biblical resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with layered clauses and pivots.
* Antithetical constructions (sweet sound vs. hollowness).
* Sermonic accumulation and intensification.
* Conditional hypotheticals that must not be simplified.

Theological Hazards:

* Confusion between visible church unity and invisible communion with Christ.
* Over-identification of true church with doctrinal purity alone.
* Pharisaic righteousness and dogmatic systems as false securities.
* Christ as the sole Head; danger of robbing Him of glory.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran sermon tone.
* Direct address to conscience.
* Sharp denunciation of pride and spiritual deception.
* Rhythmic repetition that must not be smoothed away.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "een Hjorde og een Hyrde" – John 10:16; KJV phrasing should be preserved.
* "Hjertets Paafund" – devices of the heart; biblical idiom (Gen. 6:5).
* "tilrive sig Kristi Ære" – to seize/appropriate Christ’s glory; sacrilegious connotation.
* "lydende Malm og klingende Bjelde" – 1 Cor. 13:1; sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.
* "stige op som Røg i deres Næse" – biblical image of pride/incense; offense and self-satisfaction.
* "Lyset" / "Mørket" – Johannine imagery.
* "sove paa den Pude" – lulled into false security; pastoral warning.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: All attempts to locate the unity of Christ’s body in a single visible church body have failed.
* Expansion: Human tendency to devise heart-plans alongside God’s simple truth ensures recurring attempts.
* Focused Critique: Elevation of pure doctrine as the sole mark of the Church.
* Appeal: The seductive sound of this claim to those who believe they possess pure doctrine.
* Warning: Such teaching breeds pride and false security.
* Refutation: Pure doctrine alone cannot guarantee communion with Christ.
* Analogy: Pharisaic teaching, dogmatic systems, polity, discipline, papal infallibility.
* Conclusion: Any visible bond cannot unite the visible church with the invisible Christ, and thus robs Christ of due honor.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 10:16 – one flock, one shepherd.
* 1 Corinthians 13:1 – sounding brass, tinkling cymbal.
* John 1 / 8 – light and darkness.
* Matthew 23 – Pharisees on Moses’ seat.
* Colossians 1:18 – Christ as Head of the body.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain denunciatory force against pride and deception.
* Preserve urgency and solemnity.
* No mitigation of warnings about perdition and false assurance.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" – must; theological necessity.
* "umulig" – impossible; absolute negation.
* Conditional necessity must remain uncompromised.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kristi Legeme – Christ’s Body
* Kirkesamfund – church body / ecclesial fellowship
* rene Lære – pure doctrine
* Forbindelse – communion / connection
* Hovedet – the Head

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Musical metaphors retained.
* Sleep/pillow imagery preserved.
* Visible/invisible contrast maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Sweet sound vs. deadly deception.
* Apparent orthodoxy vs. spiritual emptiness.
* Human glory vs. Christ’s honor.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorical force depends on accumulation.
* Semicolons and pivots retained.
* Suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

With these attempts to find the unity of Christ’s Body and thus to form a single church fellowship, to which all others must attach themselves if there is to be one flock and one Shepherd, men have therefore come utterly to grief. And since men never grow weary of building their own fabrications of the heart alongside the simple truth of God’s Word, and never finish devising means whereby they may lay hold of Christ’s honor for themselves, it should not surprise us if ever new attempts arise within the Church to present a single church fellowship as the only true one, which alone bears upon itself the true marks of Christ’s Church, and which alone possesses the true unity of the Church, to which all others must come if they are to have part in Christ.

Pure doctrine seems in these latter times to be made the true unity of the Church; and indeed it has a very pleasing sound in many ears when it is declared to them that a church fellowship which does not possess the pure doctrine cannot possibly have any connection with the Head, Christ. For when pure doctrine is in the world, given by God, then it is, so it seems, plain enough that all who do not acknowledge it deny God’s truth and give themselves over to the lie. But how should such men of the lie have part in the eternal Truth, Christ?

This sounds like sweet and pleasant music in the ears of those who suppose themselves to have the pure doctrine; and it rises like smoke into their nostrils when it is said: We who have the pure doctrine, we are Christ’s Bride, we are His Body. To us, who have the light, must everyone come who does not wish to perish in the darkness. Yet however well-sounding this speech may be, it is hollow as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.

And there is in that speech a power of deceivers, which is thus prepared for the congregations. For where this talk of pure doctrine is heard, and where it is said that pure doctrine is the true mark of Christ’s Bride, there men are robbed by pride, and there they are lulled to sleep by false security, and they sleep upon the pillow that is thus laid beneath their head. And if it were indeed the truth that Christ’s Church is there, and there only, where pure doctrine is found, then this would have to be preached, and the danger would have to be borne, and souls would have to perish because they took the truth in vain. But now it is a great error and a dreadful lie that the unity of Christ’s Body and the sole true mark of Christ’s Church is pure doctrine.

For even if a church fellowship possessed a doctrine as pure as that of the Pharisees upon Moses’ seat, as pure as all the subtle systems of the dogmaticians, this would yet give no assurance whatsoever that there was any connection at all between such a church fellowship and the Church’s only Head, Christ. Pure doctrine is not better able than pure polity, or pure church discipline, or the infallible Pope, how to be the unity of Christ’s Body and to present a church fellowship as the only true one. Everywhere the same thing is lacking: there is no assurance that what is put forth as the bond of union between the Church and the ascended Christ can truly bring such a union to pass.

The visible church fellowship and the invisible Christ always remain disconnected as soon as the bond is to be something visible. For a visible bond of union may indeed unite the visible church fellowship into an outward unity; but it can never unite the visible with the invisible. And every such visible means is indeed well suited to give a church fellowship lofty thoughts of itself and to lead it to delight in its own greatness; but it is wholly unsuited to bring Christ the honor that is His due.
