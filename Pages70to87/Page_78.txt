STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Saaledes" – logical-conclusive force, not merely "thus" but "in this manner / accordingly."
* "Splittelse" – theological/ecclesial division, not generic disagreement.
* "Kirke", "Legeme" – Pauline ecclesiology; must retain biblical resonance (Body of Christ).
* "Aandens Enhed" – fixed Pauline phrase (Eph. 4:3).
* "deelagtige" – participatory sharing, communion language.
* "annammes" – received/embraced, not merely accepted intellectually.
* "Troens Øie" – metaphor requiring preservation, not abstraction.
* "Vished" – certainty/assurance, not opinion.
* "formedeIst" – by virtue of / by means of.
* "Hvorsomhelst" – rhetorical breadth: wherever at all.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with causal chains introduced by "Men fordi… derfor…"
* Biblical quotation embedded without explicit citation.
* Parallel clauses requiring retention of rhythm and balance.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the invisible Church.
* Unity grounded in Spirit and Life, not institution.
* Faith as assurance of unseen realities (Heb. 11:1).
* Brotherhood/sisterhood in Christ across confessional boundaries.

Voice Hazards:

* Confessional, sermonic tone.
* Earnest ecclesiological instruction.
* Risk of flattening solemn cadence into didactic prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Aanden blæser, hvor den vil" – John 3:8; KJV resonance essential.
* "Troens Øie" – pietistic metaphor for spiritual perception.
* "Fredens Baand" – Eph. 4:3 (bond of peace).
* "Hoved over alle Ting" – Eph. 1:22; must echo KJV diction.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Assertion: Despite division, there is one Church.
* Ground: Unity of Spirit and shared Life.
* Clarification: This unity is not institutional or visible.
* Confession: We believe in one Church by faith, not sight.
* Consequence: True believers preserve unity despite external conflict.
* Culmination: Experiential recognition of unity in Christ overriding all division.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 3:8 – Spirit blowing where it wills.
* Hebrews 11:1 – Faith as assurance of unseen things.
* Ephesians 4:3–4 – One body, one Spirit, bond of peace.
* Ephesians 1:22 – Christ as Head over all things.
* Colossians / Pauline Body imagery throughout.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings against visible-church reductionism must remain firm.
The triumph of spiritual unity over schism must sound assured, not tentative.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "er" / "kan" / "kun" retain firmness and exclusivity.
* Avoid softening declarative theological claims.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kirke – Church
* Legeme – Body
* Aand – Spirit
* Liv – Life
* Tro – Faith
* Enhed – Unity

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Eye of faith.
* Seed received in hearts.
* Bonds of peace.
* Life from death, light from darkness.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Polemical clarity → doxological unity.
* Instruction → testimony → confession.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences.
* Preserve semicolon turns and rhythmic balance.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

Accordingly, despite all division, there is one Church, one Body, because there is the unity of the Spirit among all those who are partakers of the one Life. But because the unity of the Church is that of Life and of the Spirit, therefore it is not bound to any single society of those who may be called by the name of Christ. For the Spirit bloweth where it listeth, and Life springeth forth wherever the good Seed is received in believing hearts. And precisely for this reason the unity of the Church is not a visible thing like an outward ecclesiastical society, which anyone may lay hold of and feel; but it is an invisible glory, which only the eye of faith beholdeth. Therefore we also confess that we believe that the Church is one; but faith is a sure confidence of that which is not seen and not understood.

They who believe know the Christ is not divided, and that His Body is not divided; and by virtue of the Life that is in them, they are able to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, despite all strife between society and society. Whithersoever they perceive the Life of Christ in Spirit and in truth, there they recognize a brother or a sister; and in their unanimous confession of the great works of God toward them—how He saved their soul from darkness and their life from death—all else is forgotten, and all discord is overcome in a blessed assurance of a unity mightier than all division: unity with the Lord, who is Head over all things.
