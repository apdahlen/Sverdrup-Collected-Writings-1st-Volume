STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "erkjender stykkevis" – Pauline phrase (1 Cor. 13:9); must retain biblical resonance.
* "Gren af Kristi Erkjendelse" – metaphorical branch/aspect of knowledge of Christ; avoid narrowing to academic knowledge.
* "Hovedsag" – chief matter/primary thing; doctrinal weight.
* "guddommelig Orden" – divine ordering, not mere arrangement.
* "dueligst" – most fitted/apt, not simply skilled.
* "Støvbereden" – threshing floor imagery; archaic agricultural term.
* "Høst" – harvest; collective labor with differentiated tasks.
* "Anlæg" – disposition/giftedness; avoid modern psychological tone.
* "eiendommelig" – peculiar/proper to itself, not odd.
* "Berettigelse" – justification/legitimacy.
* "Lem" – member/limb; Pauline body metaphor.
* "Væxt" – growth; organic, spiritual.
* "ager[e] med sit Mund" – act/trade with one’s mouth; likely Matt. 25 (talents) adapted.
* "bringe det tilbage med Renter" – return with interest; parable language.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, chained sentences with semicolon logic.
* Parenthetical qualifications that must remain intact.
* Parallelisms (one/another; divine/human) essential to argument.
* Body metaphor clauses should not be broken into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of partial knowledge (1 Cor. 13).
* Christ’s body and growth through differentiated members (1 Cor. 12; Eph. 4).
* Divine vs. human causality without opposition.
* Gifts, calling, stewardship, and accountability (Matt. 25).
* Legitimacy of church divisions without relativizing unity in Christ.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, explanatory, pastoral-theological tone.
* Avoid modern ecumenical smoothing.
* Maintain earnest, didactic cadence and confidence.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "vi alle erkjender stykkevis" – Echo of 1 Cor. 13:9; KJV: "we know in part." Retain exact resonance.
* "Gren af Kristi Erkjendelse" – Figurative: a branch/aspect of knowing Christ; suggests organic wholeness.
* "Støvbereden" – Threshing floor; biblical-agricultural image of communal labor with distinct roles.
* "Kirken er Kristi Legeme" – Direct Pauline doctrine (1 Cor. 12).
* "Øie… Øre… Haand… Fod" – Body-member catalogue from 1 Cor. 12; KJV diction preferred.
* "ager[e]… bringe det tilbage med Renter" – Parable of the talents/minas; stewardship language.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Premise: Human knowledge of Christ is partial and varied.
* Observation: Different believers emphasize different chief aspects.
* Inference: Work is therefore divided by divine order and aptitude.
* Illustration: Threshing floor/harvest with distinct tasks.
* Application: Same principle applies within the Church.
* Conclusion (twofold): Church divisions have a divine and a human justification.
* Divine side: Organic growth of Christ’s body through diverse members.
* Human side: Varied gifts and stewardly action necessitate distinct communities.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Corinthians 13:9 – "we know in part."
* 1 Corinthians 12 – Body of Christ; eye, ear, hand, foot; many members.
* Ephesians 4 – Growth of the body through each part.
* Matthew 25 / Luke 19 – Talents/minas; trading and returning with increase.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain explanatory firmness.
* Preserve confident assertions of divine order.
* Avoid hedging language.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "er nødvendigt" – must/it is necessary.
* "kun kan vokse" – can only grow.
* "skal agere" – shall act/trade.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* erkjende – know/acknowledge (consistently "know").
* Kirke – Church.
* Lem – member/limb.
* Gaver – gifts.
* Orden – order.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve agricultural and bodily metaphors intact.
* Avoid explanatory paraphrase.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Balance calm explanation with doctrinal certainty.
* Keep the dual divine/human framing distinct yet harmonious.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences and semicolon turns.
* Maintain rhythmic repetition ("the one…the other").

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING, SVERDRUP PROFILE)

But if it may be regarded as acknowledged, that we all know in part, and that for the one a branch of the knowledge of Christ must appear as the primary concern, while the other sees nothing else than that what he has known is the chief matter, then it is surely just as certain that the one receives his share of the work, and the other his, because it is a divine order that the one is most fitted for this work, the other for that. The work is divided because it is infinitely great; but each receives his share of the work because he is the one who is most apt for this task. Just as upon the craftsman's workbench each worker has his particular assignment, because each is proficient in a peculiar direction, so also will it be within the Church, that every community has its specially appointed task, because it possesses a particular disposition in an individual direction. And we therefore arrive at the result, that the division of the Church into various church-communities has a twofold justification, which for us may be presented as on the one side a divine, on the other side a human, whereby in another sense we may indeed acknowledge that all here is divine. The one side is this, that the Church is the body of Christ and can grow only through the development of each member’s own peculiar power. It is necessary for a body that it be not exclusively eye, but likewise ear; it is necessary not only to have a sure hand, but also a firm foot, and thus there lies in the very nature of the body a necessity that it have many members. And this is the side which we call the divine; for it is an order set by God, that the body is only then in its right growth when each member develops freely. But on the other side the Church is in the world; it consists of a multitude of men with different dispositions and different gifts, and each of these shall confess and bring it back with increase; and therefore there is a human justification for the division of the Church into several communities, each with its own task, in order that the gifts of the one may come to their richest application no less than those of the other.
