STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Kirkesamfund" – not merely denominations, but ecclesial communions with theological weight.
* "Legeme" – body in the Pauline, ecclesiological sense; must retain biblical resonance.
* "Lem" – member/limb; requires consistency with 1 Corinthians 12 imagery.
* "Menighed" – congregation, with ecclesial rather than sociological force.
* "Gave" – spiritual gift (charisma), not generic talent.
* "Betragtning" – contemplation/consideration, not casual observation.
* "Enfoldighed" – spiritual simplicity/singleness of heart, not naïveté.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, hypotactic sentences with rhetorical questions and reversals.
* Semicolon logic that carries argument pivots.
* Parenthetical theological reasoning embedded in clauses.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as the Body of Christ.
* Diversity of gifts vs. false ecclesial exclusivism.
* Christ as Head of the Body (Christological and ecclesiological clarity).
* Spiritual blindness caused by party spirit.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran tone.
* Irony used to expose false clarity.
* Appeals to conscience and spiritual discernment.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "kalder sig med Kristi Navn" – echoes bearing the name of Christ; KJV resonance: “called by the name of Christ.”
* "blænde af denne Tales forførende Klarhed" – metaphor of deceptive brightness; not mere persuasion but spiritual seduction.
* "ikke dens Skin, men dens Kraft" – Pauline echo (cf. 1 Cor. 4:20); appearance vs. true power.
* "Partistridens Egengjærlighed" – party strife driven by self-love; pietistic critique of factionalism.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: apparent clarity that only one communion can be the true Church.
* Refutation by Pauline body metaphor.
* Argument from diversity of gifts within one congregation to diversity within the whole Church.
* Warning against deceptive rhetorical clarity.
* Establishment of foundational principle: Church as Christ’s Body with Christ as Head.
* Diagnosis of contemporary confusion as forgetting this principle.
* Concluding appeal to readers who retain spiritual simplicity despite party conflict.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Corinthians 12:12–27 – body and many members.
* Colossians 1:18 – Christ as Head of the Body.
* 1 Corinthians 4:20 – not appearance but power.
* Matthew 18 / Pauline ecclesiology – gifts distributed by God.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp dismissal of false reasoning ("aldeles bagvendt Snak").
* Preserve admonitory tone against being dazzled by rhetoric.
* Maintain earnest appeal to discernment and truth.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as strong necessity (must).
* Rhetorical questions preserve force and urgency.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kirke – Church
* Legeme – Body
* Lem – member
* Hoved – Head
* Gave – gift

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body/members metaphor preserved without explanation.
* Visual metaphors (blinding light, fixed gaze) retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Irony → admonition → doctrinal clarity → pastoral appeal.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional.
* Questions preserved for sermonic delivery.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

There is something which seems so immediately clear—this, namely—that among the many ecclesiastical communions which call themselves by the name of Christ, there must yet be one which alone is the true one; one communion, surely, must be Christ’s real Church and His real Body. And yet that which seems so superficially clear is very far from being true. For it has been forgotten that the Body is not one member, but many. Or could one really say: one member must surely be the real, the true Body? Or would one not at once perceive that this is altogether inverted talk? Or should God—who within the single congregation is mighty to give to each his own gift, and thereby to set each one in his proper place—not have, for the whole Christian Church, many and rich gifts to distribute, which of necessity require that different communions take up each its own task, each its own labor in the world?

Therefore we must not allow ourselves to be dazzled by the seductive clarity of such talk, but with a steady eye fix our gaze upon it and examine—not its appearance, but its power.

There is a fundamental truth which must stand fast as the point of departure for all contemplation of the Church that would be Christian; it is that which we set forth at the beginning of this treatise: that the Church is Christ’s Body, and Christ is the Head of the Body. Every discourse concerning the Church which does not point back to this must necessarily become false, because it rests upon false presuppositions. And it is in the forgetting and the setting aside of this truth that we seek the rootof all the confusion and all the obscurity which in our days prevail in this question. Therefore we believe that it is timely now to attempt to hold forth what lies within that fundamental truth, within that comprehensive principle, for consideration by those who, despite the self-love of party strife and its blindness, have yet preserved a small remnant of that humble simplicity which is necessary to recognize the truth in its purity.
