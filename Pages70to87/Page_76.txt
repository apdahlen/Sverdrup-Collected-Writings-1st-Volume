STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Enhed" as organic unity, not mere agreement.
* "Liv" as spiritual, Christ-derived life.
* "Fødsel" referring to regeneration/new birth.
* "Daaben" with sacramental Lutheran weight.
* "Tro" as living faith, not assent.
* "Aand" as Holy Spirit, not disposition.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extremely long sentences with layered causal logic.
* Parallel constructions building doctrinal progression.
* Sermonic cadence dependent on semicolons and repetitions.

Theological Hazards:

* Unity of the Church vs. institutional unity.
* Sacramental regeneration (baptism of water and Spirit).
* Distinction between visible church bodies and Christ’s true Body.
* Faith, hope, baptism as marks of the Church.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Polemical clarity without harshness.
* Didactic-sermonic rhythm that must not be modernized.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kristi Legeme" – Pauline ecclesiology (1 Cor. 12, Eph. 4).
* "Fødsel af Vand og Aand" – John 3:5 (KJV resonance).
* "een Aand til eet Legeme" – 1 Cor. 12:13.
* "Himmeriges Rige" – Matthean kingdom language.
* Blood/body metaphor – organic unity imagery.
* "Brud" – bridal ecclesiology (Eph. 5).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: True unity of the Church is unity in Christ’s life.
* Grounding: God’s Word alone reveals this unity.
* Definition: Church unity is organic, not institutional.
* Development: Life requires birth → baptism.
* Expansion: Life has essence → faith.
* Fulfillment: Life has future → hope.
* Polemic: Rejection of exclusive institutional claims.
* Conclusion: Christ’s life alone marks His Body.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 2 Cor. 10:5 – overthrowing human pride.
* John 16:13 – Spirit guiding into all truth.
* Jeremiah 1:10 – uproot and plant.
* John 3:5 – born of water and Spirit.
* 1 Cor. 12:12–13 – one body, one Spirit.
* Eph. 4:4–6 – one faith, one hope.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve firm doctrinal clarity.
* Maintain warning against false unity.
* Retain pastoral seriousness without sentimentality.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Warning vs. consolation preserved.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long periodic sentences retained.
* Semicolon pivots preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Thus we are directed back to the Word of God when we would seek the true unity of the Church, the unity of the Body of Christ. And we have this confidence, that we shall not seek in vain; for just as the Word of God has shown itself mighty to overthrow imaginations and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, so is it also mighty to guide us into all truth. The Word of God is not appointed only to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, but also to build and to plant. It has been necessary to reject the misleading paths by which human contrivance has sought to lead the Church of God, in order that there might be room for a serious examination of the uncorrupted truth of God’s Word.

The Body of Christ is one, and it has but one Head, Christ. Yet then the unity of the Church is a unity of a body, and therefore can only be unity in life. This is that which is the binding bond of the Body of Christ and its unifying principle: that the life of Christ flows through it and permeates all the individual members. Where the life of Christ is found—be it among Jews or Greeks, within this church body or that—there the Body of Christ is found. In this way every body is a precisely coherent unity, and in precisely the same way the Body of Christ also forms a perfect unity; and in this way, and in this way alone, the Church is one. Everywhere that it is found, there is the same life; and when it is asked what distinguishes this Body from all other bodies, then it is not that there is some other bond of unity than that of life, but this: that the life which here pulses in every single member is the life of Christ.

And if we would go further in the investigation of the unity of the Church, this can only take place through a deeper penetration into its peculiar life and into the necessary elements of that life. And we can immediately recognize that if it is one and the same life which thus unites the Church of Christ with itself, then it is certain that this life, like every other, takes its beginning with a birth; for only birth brings forth life, and if the life is to be the same, then the birth must also be the same. And this is something concerning which indeed all Christians are agreed: that there is but one birth whereby human beings, born of flesh, can become partakers of the life of Christ, namely the birth of water and Spirit, Baptism, with its one Spirit unto one Body.

Thus it becomes for us, who have recognized that the unity of the Body of Christ is unity in life, an indisputable truth that the unity of the Church is first and foremost a unity in Baptism with one Spirit. Here stands the first mark of the Church of Christ, and nothing else can be placed before this; for the unity of life cannot be prior to life itself, and life cannot be prior to birth.

But we can proceed further in the determination of the unity of the Church; for the life which is thus born has its own peculiar essence, which is found again everywhere. Just as the same blood flows through every vein and is found in every member of the human body, so also the life of Christ in sinful human beings everywhere has the same fundamental nature: it is faith, which is the peculiar essence of this life—the liberating knowledge of the truth and the life-giving power of love. This is that which constitutes the second element in the unity of the Church’s life: unity in one faith.

Thus we have gained a new determination of wherein the unity of the Church consists. We see that it is the one birth of the life of Christ and its one essence which become the true unity of life, that which forms fellowship in the Church. But just as the life of Christ has one source, just as the entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven is one—the birth of water and Spirit in Baptism—and just as the life of Christ has a common essence and the children of the Kingdom have a common citizenship, faith; so also the life of Christ everywhere awaits one consummation where it is found, and the Kingdom of Heaven advances toward the goal of glory, in which all its children, whether from East or West, from near or far, shall become partakers.

The Church has one future, and the Body of Christ awaits one full and eternal union with its Head; and therefore all who have the life of Christ in this world are united by one and the same hope. Thus we come to understand why the Word of God speaks of the unity of the Church not as a common subjection under a pope, not as a common association around a constitution, not as a common agreement concerning pure doctrine, but as unity in Baptism with one Spirit, unity in faith in one Savior, in hope of one glory—and we gather it all together when we say: unity in the life of Christ.

Where the life of Christ is found, there is His Body, and nowhere else. The Head is not Head for any other body than that which is permeated by its own life. Thus it will no longer surprise us that we have denied—and must deny—that any single, definite, outward church body alone can lay claim to being the true Body of Christ and His rightful Bride; for no one can prove, or even assert, that only within a single church body are there such as partake of the life of Christ. And still less can anyone point to a single church body in which all members without exception are filled with the Spirit of Christ and partake of His life.

It has indeed been claimed by the Roman Catholic Church to bear witness concerning itself that it is the one saving Church, and even more, that he who is a member of this Church is assured of having part in Christ; but this claim has already been judged, and it would scarcely be necessary once again to repeat the testimony of history. And every Lutheran Christian knows what he ought to think of anyone who dares to give himself a similar testimony.

We have recognized that the only true mark of the Body of Christ is the life of Christ; and if anyone is so endowed that he can discern where the life of Christ is found, he will also be able to point out the Body of Christ. But everyone will surely be compelled to acknowledge that the life of Christ can be found everywhere—in any church body, or apart from all ordered church bodies—where the Gospel of Christ in Word and Sacrament performs its work.
