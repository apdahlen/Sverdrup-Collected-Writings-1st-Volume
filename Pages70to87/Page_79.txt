STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Enhed / een – not merely numerical unity but spiritual, organic oneness (cf. Johannine and Pauline usage).
* Legeme / Lemmer – Pauline body imagery (1 Cor 12; Eph 4); must not be reduced to metaphorical vagueness.
* Erkjendelse – more than intellectual knowledge; experiential, saving knowledge of Christ.
* Samfund – ecclesial bodies/communions, not generic social groups.
* Aand og Sandhed – Johannine phrase (John 4:24), requires scriptural resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, sermonic sentences with semicolon logic and cumulative clauses.
* Parallel constructions (“ligesaalidt … ligesaalidt …”).
* Parenthetical theological clarifications embedded mid-sentence.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as the one Body of Christ.
* Distinction between visible plurality and invisible unity.
* Growth, sanctification, and maturity of the Body.
* Partial knowledge vs. eschatological fullness.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, pastoral, polemically restrained but firm Lutheran exhortation.
* Appeals to conscience and warning against schism.
* Risk of over-modernizing into ecumenical platitude.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kristi Legeme" – Pauline ecclesiology (1 Cor 12; Col 1).
* "ikke staar det i Menneskers Magt" – idiom of divine sovereignty over against human action.
* "erkjende stykkevis" – echo of 1 Cor 13:9; must retain biblical phrasing.
* "Fredens Baand" – direct echo of Eph 4:3 (KJV: “bond of peace”).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The unity of the Church as Christ’s life is real though invisible.
* Apparent contradiction: Many churches seem to deny this unity.
* Refutation: Visible plurality cannot dissolve Christ’s one Body.
* Positive claim: Diverse communions serve the strengthening of the one Body.
* Theological explanation: Partial knowledge of Christ distributed among many.
* Warning: Mutual denial of legitimacy damages the Church and breaks peace.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Body and members – 1 Corinthians 12.
* Cannot divide Christ – 1 Corinthians 1:13.
* Growing into maturity – Ephesians 4.
* Knowing in part – 1 Corinthians 13:9.
* Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace – Ephesians 4:3.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve firmness against despairing conclusions.
* Maintain confident assertion of divine governance.
* Retain warning against strife and schism without softening.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke" / "ligesaalidt" – must remain absolute, not probabilistic.
* Necessity of growth and diversity must sound divinely ordered, not optional.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Enhed – unity
* Legeme – Body
* Lemmer – members
* Erkjendelse – knowledge (saving/experiential)
* Samfund – communions / ecclesial bodies

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Organic body imagery must remain intact.
* Growth, strength, maturity metaphors preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Calm doctrinal exposition → hopeful affirmation → sharp warning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where the rhetoric depends on accumulation.
* Parallelisms mirrored in English syntax.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

But while in this manner the unity of the Church, which is Christ’s own life, is invisible, and while with all the Fathers we confess our faith that the Church is one, our daily experience nevertheless shows that there are many churches; and thus it might seem as though our faith were only a comforting imagination, a fabric of dreams which all reality demands that we abandon. But this is a far too hasty conclusion. The differences among the many ecclesial communions, the motley throng of churches that lies before our eyes, can in no way make void the unity of the Church or of the Body of Christ. Just as little as it is given into the power of men to divide Christ, just so little does it stand in the power of men to abolish the unity of His Body. Men may form many churches, but the Body remains one.

And in truth it is so far from being the case that the many churchly communions, if they understand their position in earnestness, dissolve the unity of the Body and assert the falsity of the Body, that they much rather, in the Lord’s governance of His redeemed people, serve only to make the Body stronger. Where it stands unshakably firm that the Body is one only, and in spirit and in truth one, permeated by the one and the same life, there cleaves to it no fear and no doubt if this Body unfolds itself in many members, and each member is governed by the same life and unfolds itself unto greater and greater strength. The strength which the individual communion unfolds is not to the Body’s harm; rather, the growth of the Body will then only become vigorous when each communion is permitted freely to unfold its indwelling power.

The division of the Church into diverse ecclesial communions is grounded in a diversity of task, a diversity of calling, which is given by the Lord. And the Lord has set the many diverse tasks in place, in order that the Body may grow unto ever greater maturity. It is indeed so that the Body of Christ in its totality has a common task, namely this: always to press deeper and deeper into the knowledge of Christ, and thereby to be made fit more and more to become like Him; but because the knowledge of Christ is infinitely rich and an inexhaustible fullness, which only eternity can give fully and completely, therefore it is given to us on earth to know in part, and no one can boast himself as one who has known all.

Therefore it can never be otherwise than that the one grasps one part of the knowledge of Christ, the other another part; and when each, with all strength and all earnestness, immerses himself to that which has been given him, the growth of the Body by no means suffers thereby, but rather prospers all the more. For the sum of this is that the knowledge of Christ increases and is enlarged, and the life of Christ is bound together in power. Thus it is no harm to the Body of Christ that the riches of the knowledge of Christ through the labor of the many communions come ever more clearly to light, but it is a gain when this great labor is divided, because thereby more labor is accomplished.

But that which harms the Body of Christ and breaks down the Church of God on earth is this: that the one communion will not acknowledge the legitimacy of the other communion’s labor. Then God’s work is disturbed, insofar as it is given into the power of men to disturb it; for when the one says to the other, Thou hast no right to exist, then strife and discord begin, then the unity of the Spirit is disrupted, because the bond of peace is broken.
