STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menigheden" / "Kirken" used with theological precision: congregation vs. the Church as Christ’s body.
* "Lemmer" / "Legeme" carry Pauline, corporeal imagery; must not be flattened to "members" in a merely organizational sense.
* "Aanden" refers to the Holy Spirit; capitalization and reverence must be preserved.
* "Naadegaver" denotes charismata; doctrinally loaded.
* "Enfoldighed" here means simplicity, not naïveté.
* "Galstab" and "Klogstab" are rhetorical contrasts (folly vs. cleverness) with moral weight.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with layered subordinate clauses and semicolon pivots.
* Repetition used for doctrinal emphasis ("Menigheden er ikke Kristi Menighed…").
* Sermonic cadence that must not be broken into short modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as the Body of Christ.
* Unity vs. diversity of gifts within the Church.
* Error of exclusivist ecclesiology (claiming only one visible communion is Christ’s body).
* The role of Word, Baptism, and Supper in constituting the Church.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran tone addressing conscience.
* Irony and warning against false wisdom.
* Pastoral urgency shaped by church conflict.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "kalde Kristus Herre" echoes 1 Cor. 12:3; KJV: "No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."
* "fremstille Kristi Legeme i Verden" – to present/make manifest Christ’s body in the world; not merely to represent.
* "Gudsordets Enfoldighed og Ringhed" – biblical paradox of divine power hidden in simplicity (cf. 1 Cor. 1–2).
* "bære de bitreste Frugter" – biblical fruit metaphor (Matt. 7).
* American context: inter-denominational polemic.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Church is Christ’s body only where Christ is Head, and unity does not mean uniformity.
* Affirmation of common Christian knowledge about the body metaphor.
* Clarification: diversity of gifts does not negate unity.
* Rejection of crude exclusion based on office.
* Introduction of a subtler, more dangerous error: exclusivist claims between church bodies.
* Historical and contemporary consequences of this error.
* Justification for treating the issue despite the seriousness of the times.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Cor. 12 throughout (body, members, gifts, one Spirit, one baptism).
* Implicit echoes of Eph. 1:22–23; Col. 1:18.
* Matt. 7:16 (fruits).
* 1 Cor. 1–3 (wisdom vs. folly).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings against false ecclesiology must remain sharp.
* Irony toward "clever" speech must be preserved.
* Pastoral concern for conscience and peace in the Church.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "er ikke" / "kan ikke" / "maa" rendered with full negating or obligatory force.
* No softening into possibility or opinion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Legeme = Body
* Lemmer = members
* Menighed = congregation
* Kirke = Church
* Aand = Spirit
* Naadegaver = gifts of grace

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body imagery retained throughout.
* Fruit imagery retained.
* Head/body relationship preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Calm doctrinal exposition → warning → polemical urgency.
* Contrast between peace that ought to be and strife that is.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where argument unfolds.
* Parallelisms preserved.
* Rhetorical repetitions maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

\subsection{The Church and the Ecclesiastical Communions}

\begin{quote}
But now are they many members, yet but one body.
1 Cor. 12:20
\end{quote}

It is a truth of God revealed in Christ, that the congregation is not Christ’s congregation unless Christ is its Head, and the congregation is not Christ’s congregation unless it is Christ’s Body. And however little this truth is acknowledged, and however scant a trace we see of the Church, with the full earnestness of life, seeking to present the Body of Christ in the world, it nevertheless belongs to those things of which all have knowledge, that the Church is Christ’s Body, and that each single congregation, with Christ’s Word and Christ’s Baptism, with His Supper, is a manifestation of Christ’s Body. And no one whom the Spirit has taught to call Christ Lord is ignorant that he is a member of Christ’s Body; for he has perceived and experienced how Christ’s life is his, how it flows through him, ennobling him by the one Spirit, by whom we are all baptized to be one Body.

But just as little as any Christian is ignorant that we are thus all members of Christ’s Body, just so little is it to him a strange or new thing that not all members have the same work. No one is surely so devoid of understanding of the form of Christ’s Body and of the Spirit’s diverse gifts of grace in the congregation that he should think all the members of the congregation must necessarily have the same work in the congregation. No one is surely so simple-minded that he says: because you are not a pastor in the congregation, therefore you do not belong to Christ’s Body; because you are not a teacher, therefore you are no Christian; because you are not an elder of the congregation, therefore you have no part in Christ. Indeed, we are almost all agreed that such speech is madness.

But there is another speech, which indeed does not come to us with the simplicity and lowliness of God’s Word, but with much cleverness and human authority, and which for that very reason ought to be suspicious to us; there is another speech which is just as perverse, but not as plain-spoken. It too is a speech about Christ’s Body, about Christ’s Church, which has fallen into distress, and which therefore has borne the bitterest fruits in the history of the Church and bears them to this very day. And now it sounds round about us, and it confuses consciences and stirs up strife and discord where there ought to be forbearance and love. Therefore we must consider it well and closely; therefore we must view it in the light of the Word and of history and judge it accordingly.

It is this old speech we have in mind: that just as Christ’s Body is one, so the Church also is one; of all the many ecclesiastical communions there is only one which is in truth Christ’s Body, His one true Bride. Therefore the one church body asserts against the other: Because you are not as I am, therefore you are not Christ’s Body; because you do not belong to me, therefore you do not belong to Christ. Therefore it is heard here in America so often among us: Because you are another communion than we, therefore you cannot be Christ’s Church.

And if this question did not stand so near to us, and with such necessity press demand an answer, we should not treat it here; for time is as precious as it is serious, and no Christian in these days can have time for useless and contentious questions, such as it is the duty of Christians at all times to flee and avoid.
