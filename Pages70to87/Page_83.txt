STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Enhed" (unity) in an ecclesiological, organic sense, not mere agreement.
* "Kirkesamfund" as an organic ecclesial body, not a voluntary association.
* "Ret til at bestaa" meaning legitimate right to exist before God and history.
* "Levekraft" as spiritual vitality, not institutional survival.
* "Lem paa Kristi Legeme" as Pauline ecclesiology (1 Cor. 12), requiring organic participation.
* "Eneret" implying exclusive salvific monopoly.
* "Bannet" referring to anathema/excommunication with eschatological force.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long periodic sentences with layered subordinate clauses.
* Semicolon logic and accumulative argumentation.
* Repetitions used for rhetorical pressure.
* Conditional constructions that must retain logical force.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as Christ’s Body.
* Relation between unity and diversity in ecclesial development.
* Legitimacy grounded in divine vocation rather than historical continuity.
* Condemnation of ecclesial exclusivism as anti-Christian.
* Use of Gamaliel’s saying (Acts 5:38–39).

Voice Hazards:

* Strong prophetic denunciation toward the end.
* Earnest, judicial tone addressing conscience.
* Danger of softening polemical force against ecclesial arrogance.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kirkens Væxt og dens Udvikling" — organic metaphor of growth; must not be reduced to institutional change.
* "Brændende i Nutiden" — figurative urgency; render as "burning question of our time."
* "Ranere til sig" — violent metaphor of usurpation.
* "Sidder paa Tronen i Guds Menighed" — biblical irony echoing 2 Thess. 2.
* Gamaliel quotation aligns naturally with KJV Acts 5:39.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Recapitulation of prior conclusions on unity and plurality.
* Introduction of a sharper, contemporary question: legitimacy of divisions.
* Rejection of mere historical rupture as decisive.
* Positive criterion: spiritual vitality grounded in Christ.
* Further criterion: a distinct divine task within the Church’s life.
* Mutual recognition as moral obligation.
* Final warning against exclusivism and ecclesial pride.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 5:38–39 (Gamaliel).
* 1 Corinthians 12 (Body and members).
* Ephesians 4 (one Spirit, one goal).
* 2 Thessalonians 2 (Antichrist sitting in God’s temple).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain accusatory force in denunciations.
* Preserve earnest exhortation toward humility and mutual recognition.
* Avoid neutral academic tone in climactic passages.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must."
* "kan ikke" as absolute impossibility.
* Obligations rendered with moral necessity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Church
* Communion/participation in Christ
* Body of Christ
* Member
* Divine work

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Organic body imagery retained.
* Judicial and royal metaphors (throne, judgment seat) preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Calm analytical beginning.
* Rising moral urgency.
* Sharp prophetic climax.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where intentional.
* Rhetorical repetition maintained.
* Suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

We have seen wherein the unity of the Church consists, and we have seen what it is that calls forth the many ecclesiastical communions; yet our task is not thereby concluded. For here there arises yet another question of the greatest importance, which in truth is the most burning one of our own time. If the very growth of the Church and its development require a division into several church communions, then it is of the utmost importance to know whether every division of the Church is thus for the Church’s good, and whether every church communion, without further consideration, has the right to exist.

We shall begin with the latter question, and upon the foundation which we have now sought to lay, attempt an answer to that question upon which a church communion’s right to exist depends. From ancient times it has been an assertion of the Catholic Church against the Protestant communions, that they had no right to exist, because they were founded upon a breach with the Catholic Church; and it is again a very common assertion in our own days, from one communion against another, that it has no right to exist. There is renewed and earnest talk of breaches of one communion from another, and there is an outcry over legalistic rights, because development brings it with it that new church communions arise.

For this reason we believe that a calm discussion of this question, independent of party inclinations, is in its proper place and comes at its proper time. And if we have not altogether erred in our preceding exposition, it will be seen that we must arrive at the conclusion that a church communion’s right to exist independently rests upon its own vital power. “If this work be of God,” says Gamaliel, “ye cannot overthrow it.”

But we have seen that a church communion only then bears this name with justice, and only then can possess vital power, when it is a member of the Body of Christ. Participation in Christ, unity with Him, is the first condition and the fundamental condition for the existence of every church communion. Yet if a communion is to have the right to exist alongside others, if it is to have the right to be an independent member of the Body, then it must have its own peculiar task, its distinctive ministry. It is precisely this that will come into question; and every communion which is unable to demonstrate its particular task within ecclesiastical development lacks the fundamental condition for being independent.

But where a church communion can show that it has a work to do which hitherto was neglected, where it can show that it has an aspect of the knowledge of Christ to set forth and a branch of the life of Christ to unfold which finds no place within the already existing communions, there it has its right to exist; and there the already existing communions have the duty to acknowledge that right, if they would not be found among those who strive against God.

Only in this way can the Protestant communions defend their right to exist alongside the Catholic Church, and only in this way can, in our own time, every church communion assert its right as independent. And only under this presupposition can it be made a duty for one communion to acknowledge another alongside itself. And only when the many communions respect one another’s work and mutually acknowledge one another as those who are set by God to labor in one Spirit forward toward one goal, which stands above them all and is greater than them all—only then will the Church in its totality, the Body of Christ, go forward with power and accomplish its work with life.

But where a single church communion seats itself upon the judgment seat, and where it claims for itself an exclusive right to be Christ’s Church and an exclusive right to exist; where, in mad arrogance, it seizes to itself the honor of alone being the Body of Christ, and with blasphemy against God’s saving power calls itself alone saving and delivers the remaining communions over to eternal perdition, and hurls the ban against those whom God has marked with the mark of Christ and made partakers of His own life—there such a church communion has stamped itself with the sign of Antichrist, he who is God’s enemy and yet sits upon the throne in God’s congregation.

It is not the division of the Church into many communions that undermines God’s work among us, but factionalism and the striving after one’s own honor and one’s own power; these are what bring the Church to humiliation, God’s honor to diminishment, and stagnate God’s work.
