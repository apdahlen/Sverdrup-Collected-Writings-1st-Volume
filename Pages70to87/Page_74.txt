STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Enhed" (unity) – carries ecclesiological and mystical weight beyond mere organizational unity.
* "Kristi Legeme" (the Body of Christ) – Pauline ecclesiology; must retain sacramental and spiritual force.
* "Forsamlingen" – not merely a gathering, but congregation/church assembly with theological import.
* "Kirketugt" – church discipline; disciplinary authority, not moral self-restraint.
* "Kjendetegn" – mark or sign; echoes the Lutheran notae ecclesiae debate.
* "Stand" – estate or order, not social class in modern sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long argumentative sentences with semicolon logic.
* Repeated negations building polemical force.
* Parallel constructions that must remain intact to preserve cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church’s unity and visibility/invisibility.
* Relationship between ecclesial office and Christ’s headship.
* Sacramental and disciplinary marks versus spiritual incorporation into Christ.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical, confessional Lutheran tone addressing false claims.
* Earnest insistence on Scripture as sole ground of judgment.
* Warning against false security in outward church forms.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "binde Kristi Legeme sammen" – to hold together/unify; echoes Eph. 4 imagery.
* "udenfor Samfundet med Paven" – outside communion with the Pope; Roman Catholic reference.
* "den ene raadende" – sole ruling authority; must retain exclusivity.
* "i dets rette Form" – in its proper form; theological normativity.
  KJV parallels: "Body of Christ," "members," "head," "communion."

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Denial: No person or office constitutes the Church’s unity.
* Refutation: Rejection of claims identifying unity with papal or institutional control.
* Counter-claim presented: Unity located in visible assemblies and discipline.
* Rebuttal: Scripture-based assertion that assemblies do not constitute the Body’s unity.
* Conclusion: No congregation guarantees membership in Christ’s Body.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Pauline imagery: Body, members (1 Corinthians 12; Ephesians 4).
* Headship of Christ (Colossians 1).
* Visibility/invisibility tension (Luke 17:20–21 implied).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and negations retained without softening. Polemical clarity maintained.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal" / "vil" rendered with firm declarative force.
* Negations preserved absolutely ("is not," "no," "none").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kristi Legeme = Body of Christ
* Enhed = unity
* Forsamling = assembly/congregation
* Kirketugt = church discipline

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

Body/member imagery preserved without explanatory dilution.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

Contrast between human claims and divine judgment retained.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long sentences and rhythmic repetitions preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

No human being is thus the unity of the Church, nor is any human estate—be it anointed bishops or ordained pastors. No such person binds together the Body of Christ, and no one is excluded from the Body of Christ because he stands outside communion with the Pope or outside connection with the highly-placed bishops and priests. Yet we encounter other assertions concerning the unity of the Church, which would vindicate the right of particular church-communions to be the Body of Christ. It is said that it is the grossest of all errors to claim that the Pope is the unity and head of the Church; it is the greatest of all lies to say that the Body of Christ is there, and only there, where he alone rules. But, it is added, the Body of Christ is therefore not invisible, such that one should not know where it is and where it is not. The assembly—the right and sound church order with the vigorous exercise of church discipline—that, in truth, is the mark of the Body of Christ. Bring all Christians to acknowledge this, and the unity of the Body of Christ will be present and will consist in the unity of the assemblies. Let each congregation teach as it will, and administer the sacraments as it will; the unity will still be there, and we shall have the Body of Christ in its proper form. But we again hold fast to our proposition, well grounded in the Word of God, by which we judge all things; and we say again: the assembly is not the unity of the Body of Christ; for there is no assembly in the world—however much church discipline may be bound up with it—that secures for the congregation which possesses it, acknowledges it, and employs it, any place in the Body of Christ as a member thereof.
