STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Udvælgelsen – election in the biblical–theological sense, not mere choice.
* Verden – the fallen world-order, not simply creation.
* Guds Ord – the revealed Word of God, bearing doctrinal weight.
* Profetiens Lys – prophetic revelation, not abstract foresight.
* Fortabelse – perdition, eternal loss, not mere ruin.
* Kjød / Aand – Pauline flesh vs. Spirit, not body vs. soul.
* Forskriften – the Law or prescription, especially Mosaic Law.
* Kaldet – divine vocation or calling, not invitation.
* Skaabet – destiny or appointed lot, providentially set.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with antithetical clauses.
* Heavy use of semicolons to pivot argument.
* Sermonic rhythm that must not be flattened.
* Embedded biblical citation and paraphrase.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of election and vocation of Israel.
* Contrast between revelation and pagan divination.
* Flesh vs. Spirit conflict as ongoing covenantal reality.
* Prophetic clarity versus human doubt and lust.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, solemn, and historical-prophetic tone.
* Risk of modernizing into neutral historical prose.
* Risk of softening judgment language (perdition, rebellion).

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "elske Verden" – not worldly desire, but loving service toward the world.
* "bære paa en forløftet Skat" – carrying a promised treasure; echoes stewardship of revelation.
* "tung Gang" – pilgrimage imagery, suffering vocation.
* Pagan practices (soothsayers, diviners, dream-interpreters, oracles) echo Deut. 18.
* "mørkt Sted" – 2 Peter 1:19 resonance; KJV phrasing appropriate.
* "Vi vil ikke vandre paa Herrens Vei" – covenant rebellion formula.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Israel’s election set it apart from the nations.
* Contrast: Nations grasp and perish; Israel bears and suffers.
* Support: Possession of God’s Word and prophetic light.
* Development: Clear eschatological goal versus pagan uncertainty.
* Conflict: Flesh vs. Spirit within Israel’s history.
* Conclusion: Ongoing struggle between divine calling and human resistance.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Numbers 23:23 explicitly cited (Balaam oracle).
* Deuteronomy’s polemic against divination.
* Pauline anthropology (flesh vs. Spirit).
* Petrine imagery of light shining in darkness.
* Wilderness journey as typological pilgrimage.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain severity of judgment on the nations.
* Preserve weight of Israel’s suffering vocation.
* Retain sharpness of Israel’s repeated refusal.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* skulde – must / was called to.
* ikke behøver – does not need to (no weakening).
* vil ikke – deliberate refusal.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Udvælgelsen – election
* Guds Ord – Word of God
* Profetiens Lys – light of prophecy
* Kjød – flesh
* Aand – Spirit
* Kald – calling

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Pilgrimage imagery retained.
* Light/darkness contrast preserved.
* Conflict imagery (stormfuld, brydninger) retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between glory of calling and tragedy of resistance.
* Severity followed by sorrow, not sentimentality.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically necessary.
* Semicolon pivots maintained.
* Proclamatory rhythm retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

While all the other peoples desired the world and its goods, and sought to tear them to themselves and to rob one another, Israel, by the election, was called to love the world; and so far from robbing anything from the world or snatching anything from the poor race of mankind, the people of Israel were rather, in love and compassion and sorrow, to bear within themselves a promised treasure, which they should always be willing to share with all: the Word of God. With a rich gift for the world Israel went its heavy way and suffered for the peoples, while the peoples tumbled themselves in the lust of the world and reaped perdition from their sin.

But in the light of the Word of God Israel was, under its heavy pilgrimage, to see the goal clearly and shining before it; and while the heathen groped in the darkness, ever fearing the uncertain future, while they sought soothsayers and diviners and casters of lots and interpreters of dreams and oracles, in order to gain some clarity concerning the things to come, Israel was to have the light of prophecy burning and shining in a dark place. As Balaam had said: “— in thy time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, what God doeth.” (Num. 23:23).

It is the glory of the election that Israel may walk in the light of the Word. And herein the history of Israel, and of all God’s people, becomes different from all other history: that it not only has its goal—for all history has that—but that the goal is clearly and distinctly set before the people, so that the ancient people may lift up its gaze with certainty and courage toward the eternal kingdom which the Lord will prepare, and that by the light of prophecy the way to the goal is clearly marked out, so that it need not go astray.

But against the light of the Word rises the doubt and cleverness of the understanding, and against the heavy duty of the calling rises the lust of the flesh. And the whole history of Israel becomes filled with an unceasing struggle between flesh and Spirit, between prescription and faith, so that scarcely is there given on earth a more torn and storm-filled history than that of God’s people. God has set the calling and the destiny, and he continually raises up men and women in Israel who lift its glory and its responsibility high before a corrupt and perverse people; and again and again the great multitude in Israel spares itself and says: We will not walk in the way of the Lord! And thus there arise violent upheavals and heart-rending struggles between God’s glorious calling and the fleshly nature of the people.
