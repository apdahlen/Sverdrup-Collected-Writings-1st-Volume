STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Øieblik" – archaic spelling; moment/instant with narrative weight.
* "gjennem" – through; implies penetration, not mere passage.
* "trængte op" – pressed through/upward; prayer imagery of ascent.
* "strædet" – strove/contended; spiritual wrestling.
* "Rids stille Kampe" – life’s quiet, grinding struggles; not dramatic battles.
* "Bønhørt" – heard/answered in prayer; covenantal nuance.
* "Vantro" – unbelief; active negation of faith, not doubt.
* "Afguder" – idols; dead gods in polemical contrast.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, chained sentences with semicolon logic.
* Parallel biblical exempla (Jacob, Moses) requiring cohesion.
* Sermonic cadence; do not fragment.

Theological Hazards:

* Prayer as effectual before the living, personal God.
* Election language ("Herrens Udvalgte").
* Faith vs. materialism/idolatry.
* Fatherhood of God and covenant mercy.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Polemical sharpness against unbelief/materialism.
* Pastoral consolation without sentimental softening.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* Prayer that "breaks through all hindrances" – biblical imagery of prevailing prayer.
* Jacob at Jabbok – Genesis 32; wrestling faith.
* Moses on the mountain – intercessory striving (Exod. 32–34).
* "Gaat hen i Fred" – KJV-style benediction ("Go in peace").
* "Gud hører Bønner" – formula expressing divine personal responsiveness.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Recognition of true prayer by Eli.
* Consolation given; benediction pronounced.
* Hanna strengthened for daily life.
* Fulfillment of prayer in Samuel’s birth.
* Name as theological testimony.
* Prayer as the secret of God’s people.
* Ongoing conflict between faith and unbelief across ages.
* Samuel as emblematic champion of faith.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Samuel 1:17 explicitly cited.
* Genesis 32 (Jacob at Jabbok).
* Mosaic intercession (Exodus).
* Implicit theology of answered prayer throughout Scripture.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness of assertions about faith’s victory.
* Retain polemical contrast with materialism and idolatry.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity in divine vocation ("skulde").
* Certainty in God’s hearing of prayer.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Prayer – consistently effectual petition.
* Faith / unbelief – sharp contrast maintained.
* God as living, personal, almighty Father.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Wrestling, struggle, battle imagery retained.
* Living God vs. dead idols preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Consolation to Hanna vs. polemic against Israel’s drift.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and rhythmic balance suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

It struck Eli in an instant. For the old man knew well that such was the prayer which breaks through all hindrances and presses its way up to the living God, Israel’s mighty Father. Thus had Jacob wrestled in the night by the Jabbok. Thus had Moses striven upon the mountain for the faithless people and for those chosen from among them. Eli understood that he stood face to face with one of the Lord’s elect, and his words were heart‑comforting for Hannah: “Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him” (1 Sam. 1:17).

Comforted and relieved, Hannah went to her home. The encounter with the Lord in the sanctuary had given her new courage to take hold of life’s daily round of quiet struggles and the toil, burden, and weariness of household labor. In the great conflict and the bitter sorrow, her heart had been strengthened for the lesser sorrows and cares through which she yet must pass.

The Lord fulfilled Hannah’s prayer. She received a son and called his name Samuel; it means, “Heard of God”; for, said she, of the Lord have I asked him.

This time the son’s name is full truth. By prayer he was given; and in prayer the strength of his life was to abide. This is the secret of the life of God’s people, that God hears prayers. It is the expression of God’s fatherly heart toward His children. And it is faith’s proper victory over all unbelief and materialism, that it prays to the living, personal God and is heard. Around this stood the great conflict in the days of Samuel, as it repeats itself also now, after three thousand years have passed away.

God’s living personality and the conquering power of faith lie most simply and most clearly expressed in the word: God hears prayers. And around this all in Samuel’s life was to turn—to bear witness for Israel to the living, almighty God, the merciful and gracious Father, whom Israel was in danger of exchanging for dead idols, and to that distinctive power of faith which was to be Israel’s mark and the world‑overcoming strength.

Samuel, therefore, is the name that designates the champion of God over against the seductive powers of idolatry and materialism. Samuel is the name that designates the giant of faith over against the coldness of unbelief and the darkness of superstition.
