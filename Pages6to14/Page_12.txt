STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Flertoneriet – archaic/pietistic term for polygamy; must not be weakened to neutral sociological language.
* Skinneri – strife, rivalry, quarrelsomeness with moral bitterness.
* Kummerfuldt – sorrow-laden, oppressive; stronger than mere sadness.
* Bedrøvelse / Nød / Sorg – overlapping grief terms requiring careful differentiation.
* Aand / aandelige – must retain theological sense of Spirit, not mere psychology.
* Bod – repentance in Lutheran sense, not generic remorse.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with semicolon logic must be preserved.
* Embedded biblical quotation (Psalm 113:9) must remain recognizably scriptural.
* Parallel contrasts (sorrow/joy, many sons/one son, outward/inward piety).

Theological Hazards:

* Divine agency in suffering (“Herren havde gjort det saa”) must not be softened.
* Theology of suffering as consecration for joy.
* Distinction between outward godliness and inward regeneration.
* Concepts of repentance, faith, and full surrender.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, admonitory Lutheran tone must not be modernized.
* Critique of clergy motivated by social advantage must retain sharpness.
* Address to conscience and spiritual seriousness must not be diluted.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Krænkelse af Guds Orden” – violation of God’s created order; echoes Genesis.
* “Udøste hun sit Hjerte” – biblical idiom (cf. 1 Sam. 1:15; Ps. 62:8).
* “Den ufrugtbare skulde bo i Huset” – direct biblical diction; KJV resonance.
* “Sjælens død” – spiritual death, not emotional numbness.
* “Suk og et lidet Stik i Samvittigheden” – fleeting remorse without repentance.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Polygamy violates God’s order and inevitably produces misery.
* Women’s suffering persists even in societies claiming moral progress.
* Hanna exemplifies this suffering in its fullness.
* God sovereignly ordains her barrenness to reveal His glory.
* True joy and blessing are born through sorrow and prayer.
* Eli represents outward piety without inward spiritual struggle.
* Warning against clergy lacking true repentance and spiritual life.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Samuel 1–2 (Hanna, Eli, Samuel).
* Psalm 113:9 explicitly quoted.
* Implicit echoes of Psalm 62:8, Luke 1:52, John 12:24.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain severity in critique of polygamy and hollow religiosity.
* Preserve divine purpose language in suffering.
* Maintain pastoral urgency and doctrinal weight.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “Skulde,” “kunde,” “vilde” rendered with full necessity or intention.
* Avoid conditional softening where the text asserts divine certainty.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Gud – God
* Aand – Spirit
* Bod – repentance
* Tro – faith
* Glæde/Fryd – joy (distinguish degrees by context)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sorrow as consecration.
* Life and death of the soul.
* Heart poured out before God.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Sharp denunciation → consolation → warning.
* Do not flatten emotional or theological contrasts.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long clauses and sermonic rhythm.
* Maintain suitability for oral proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Elkanah had two wives; and this unhappy violation of God’s order, which was and is so common among the peoples of the East, brought also in Elkanah’s house the usual restless consequences. Quarreling and bitterness, sorrow and tears have followed polygamy everywhere, and do so unto this very day. Women often have hard conditions and a burdensome life even among us, who boast that we have lifted them up out of subjection and bondage. When once the voice of the oppressed and tormented shall be heard in righteousness and truth, it will be made manifest that many a sorrowful and broken woman has borne more heart, even among us, than many have been able to imagine. Yet both the one and the other woman suffers among us wherever polygamy rules, and this becomes common and daily. Hannah, the mother of Samuel, was also made to prove this in full measure. She had no children, while the other wife rejoiced in sons and daughters.

Hannah’s lot was heavy and painful; yet the Lord had made it thus for Hannah, because He would reveal His glory and highly exalt the humbled and bitterly afflicted woman. “The barren woman shall dwell in the house as a joyful mother of children” (Psalm 113:9). And there was to be more blessing in the one son who was given her in her sorrow and prayers than in many sons and daughters over whom there had been jubilation and delight. The heart learns first in distress and sorrow the great mystery of yielding itself wholly to God; and only that life which has been consecrated through sorrow is able to become a full fountain of joy both for itself and for the people of God.

Hannah had learned to find consolation in sorrow and help in distress. To God she went with her affliction, and before Him she poured out her heart in His sanctuary. Israel’s high priest, Eli, was witness to her prayer in that hour of endurance. He was a respectable and agreeable man. Calm and without clamor was the stamp of his inner life. Appointed from childhood to be the Lord’s high priest and the spiritual leader of God’s people, he had doubtless also from childhood been accustomed to the Word of God and the temple of God. It was to Eli so familiar, so everyday, so commonplace. It seemed to follow of itself that he should be God-fearing, at least outwardly. And though he could not entirely avoid many serious thoughts and moving moments, yet earnestness and the struggle of life seemed not to have laid hold of his whole soul.

Thus it goes with many who have become priests and servants of God from outward considerations: for the sake of the family, for the sake of honor and reputation, or even for the sake of livelihood. Their hearts do indeed feel a seriousness and gravity; yet it often passes away with a sigh and a small prick of conscience, and of any share in full surrender to God in repentance and faith there is often nothing at all. Such priests indeed know the Word of God, but not the Spirit of God; and the inward spiritual movements and the struggle, the death of the soul and the fear of sin, the joy of the Spirit and the gladness of the life of God are things unknown to them. They account it enthusiasm or madness, or at least a peculiarity.
