STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "een Henseende" — archaic orthography; must be rendered as "one respect" without weakening emphasis.
* "Eiendom for Gud" — covenantal ownership language; must not be reduced to mere possession.
* "Syndelyst" — more than inclination; denotes inward lust toward sin.
* "Udvælgelsen" — election in a theological, not sociological, sense.
* "Kund" — archaic for commission/mandate/message entrusted by God.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with balanced contrasts (nature vs. election).
* Embedded biblical quotations forming logical pivots.
* Semicolon logic must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of election vs. natural equality of mankind.
* Grace not grounded in righteousness.
* Israel’s mediatorial calling for the nations.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, didactic tone addressing theological conscience.
* Any modernization risks flattening sermonic gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "et Folk til Eiendom for Gud" echoes Exod. 19:5 (KJV: "a peculiar treasure").
* "haardnakket Folk" echoes KJV "stiffnecked people" (Deut. 9:6).
* "bor for sig selv" — spiritual separation, not isolationism (Num. 23:9).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: God’s people are distinct only by divine election.
* Clarification: By nature Israel shares full human corruption and need.
* Scriptural proof: Moses’ testimony in Deuteronomy.
* Conclusion: Election grants Israel a unique historical calling and trust.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Deuteronomy 7:7; 9:6 — election by grace alone.
* Numbers 23:9 — Balaam’s oracle of separation.
* Exodus 19:5 implied — treasured possession.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain firmness: no sentimental softening of sin or grace.
* Maintain didactic clarity and reverent gravity.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and divine action must remain absolute ("alone," "only").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Udvælgelse → election
* Kald → calling
* Guds Ord → the Word of God

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve imagery of lifting Israel from among the nations.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between natural equality and elected distinction must remain sharp.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved for proclamation rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\section{The Prophet Samuel}

[Source: Quarterly Journal. 7th Year. 1881. Pages 142–174. Separate offprint. “Vinggaardsmanden” Publishing House. 1903. — Ed.]

God’s people are, in one respect, distinguished above all other peoples upon the earth. They are an elect people, a people for God’s own possession. In other respects there is no difference between Israel and the other nations. There is the same human nature, the same lust toward sin, the same needs, the same struggle for existence and for life among all peoples, Israel not excepted. “The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people” (Deut. 7:7), says Moses, through whom the LORD had also said: “Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people” (Deut. 9:6).

By nature Israel is like the heathen; but by election it is lifted up out of the multitude of the nations, and it became true what Balaam said when he saw the camp of Israel spread out before him: “Lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations” (Num. 23:9).

Election made Israel unique among the peoples, and its life and history are unique in the history of the world. For election gave Israel a particular calling in the world and a particular trust from God. Israel alone received the special calling to become a blessing to all nations, and Israel alone received the special calling that the Word of God should be entrusted to it.
