STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "hensunken" – not merely "absorbed" but sunk down, bowed, immersed in prayer.
* "Bedrøvelse" – grief, affliction with moral-spiritual weight, not mild sadness.
* "afstumpede aandelige Sans" – blunted/spiritually dulled faculty of discernment.
* "Nødens og Bønnens Hemmelighed" – the mystery/secret of distress-driven prayer.
* "Aasyn" – countenance/face as moral-spiritual indicator.
* "Læber bevægede sig efter hendes Hjertes Lanter" – lamps/lights of the heart: inner stirrings guiding speech.
* "embedsmæssige Fromhed" – official, office-bound piety lacking inward life.
* "Aandsvirkninger" – workings/effects of the Spirit, not mere emotions.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, cascading sentences with embedded explanations and biblical parallels.
* Semicolon logic requiring preservation of sermonic pacing.
* Participial phrases describing interior states must not be broken into flat clauses.

Theological Hazards:

* Prayer arising from anguish versus performative prayer.
* Misjudgment of spiritual phenomena as drunkenness (Acts 2 echo).
* Consecration of the promised son—sacrificial love versus possessive desire.
* Distinction between outward religiosity and inward spiritual discernment.

Voice Hazards:

* Risk of softening rebuke of Eli’s spiritual dullness.
* Risk of modernizing Hanna’s prayer into sentimental piety.
* Loss of exhortational seriousness and Lutheran gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "fulde af sød Vin" – Acts 2:13; KJV phrasing should be echoed.
* "skriger af det dybe" – Psalm 130:1; KJV: "Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD."
* "trængt frem til Herrens Hjerte" – metaphor for prevailing in prayer; avoid rationalizing.
* "ofre ham til Gud og hans Folk" – sacrificial dedication, not symbolic gesture.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Example introduced: Eli’s misjudgment of Hanna.
* Diagnosis: spiritual dullness misreads true prayer.
* Contrast: Eli’s official piety vs. Hanna’s life-and-death supplication.
* Resolution: Hanna’s self-conquest and consecrated love.
* Climactic clarification: true prayer as a cry from the depths.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Samuel 1 – Hanna praying silently before the LORD.
* Acts 2:13 – Apostles accused of drunkenness.
* Psalm 130 – Crying out of the depths.
* Biblical anthropology: countenance revealing the soul.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp critique of Eli’s blindness.
* Preserve anguish-driven urgency of Hanna’s prayer.
* Avoid sentimental consolation; keep moral seriousness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and impossibility implied in Hanna’s condition must remain strong.
* Eli’s incapacity to understand must not be weakened.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand / Spirit – consistently capitalized where divine action is implied.
* Bøn / prayer – retained as earnest supplication, not generic prayerfulness.
* Nød / distress – maintained as existential-spiritual crisis.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Heart lamps, countenance, opening of the soul, struggle for life.
* Do not paraphrase into abstractions.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward Eli contrasted with quiet strength and peace in Hanna.
* Movement from misunderstanding to spiritual clarification.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentence flow suitable for proclamation.
* Preserve rhythmic clauses and sermonic rise and fall.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

So it went also with Eli. He saw Hanna sunk down in prayer; her bitter affliction pressed her low, and her pain was too great for her to find words for it. But Eli did not understand what was stirring within this neglected heart, and his blunted spiritual sense did not so much as divine the mystery of distress and prayer. Therefore it seemed to him incomprehensible what it was that truly moved the woman, whose bitterly sorrowing and sorely oppressed mind was mirrored in her countenance, and whose lips moved according to the inner longings of her heart, without any audible word passing over them. Eli supposed her to be drunken, much as those who were witnesses of the outpouring of the Spirit upon the Apostles supposed that they were “full of new wine.” It is that spiritual sluggishness, that heartless indifference to the need or the joy of others, that materialistic incapacity to comprehend the nature of the Spirit, which here makes itself known. Eli’s official piety was unacquainted with such soul-rending workings of the Spirit as those Hanna experienced in her soul.

But Hanna had prayed as one who struggles for life, and she had vowed to the Lord the son for whom she had pleaded. There was full earnestness in her soul; and when she prayed for a son, it was not with the selfish desire to have him for herself, but with the true love’s willingness to offer him up to God and to His people. She had won peace in the struggle; she had conquered herself and the turmoil of her agitated mind; she had pressed through to the heart of the Lord and found mercy, and she was able calmly to answer Eli’s harsh and almost mocking words.

She told Eli what had been hidden from him. It was not wine or strong drink that made her so strange and incomprehensible to men; but anguish of heart and soul, which had opened her whole being before God, had made her manner a mystery to men. She had prayed, not as one who prays in order to display an ability before God, but as one who cries out of the depths unto the Lord.
