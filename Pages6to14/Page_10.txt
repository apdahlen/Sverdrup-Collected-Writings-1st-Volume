STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "forloren Søn" – biblical idiom (Prodigal Son), not merely "lost son"
* "Verdens Lyst" – not neutral pleasure, but sinful worldly desire
* "Trældom" – bondage/slavery with spiritual weight
* "opvakte Frelser(e)" – deliverers in the Judges sense, not soteriological Christ-language, yet typological
* "Aandens Kraft" – Spirit-empowered, must retain pneumatological force
* "Udvælgelsen" – election, covenantal choosing
* "forstødt" – rejected, cast off, with strong covenantal overtones

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, chained sentences with concessive clauses
* Parallel contrasts (Israel’s unfaithfulness vs. the Lord’s faithfulness)
* Sermonic pacing with cumulative clauses

Theological Hazards:

* Covenant faithfulness vs. human unfaithfulness
* Typological use of Samson
* Election, grace, deliverance, judgment

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, solemn, exhortational tone
* Moral warning against worldliness
* Typological seriousness—must not sound like mere narrative

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "forloren Søn" echoes Luke 15; KJV "prodigal son" is appropriate
* "smage Bitterheden" – experiential knowledge of judgment
* "i Aandens Kraft" – echoes biblical language (e.g., Judges 14:6)
* "Verdens Trældom" – Pauline resonance (Gal. 4)

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Lord remained faithful despite Israel’s unfaithfulness
* Evidence: Judges and their deliverance
* Decline: Moral and spiritual decay culminating in Samson
* Typology: Samson as image of Israel
* Hope: Sacrificial death and future through divine intervention
* Transition: Preparation for Samuel

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Luke 15 (Prodigal Son)
* Judges narratives (esp. Judges 13–16)
* Covenant language from Pentateuch
* Sacrificial overtones anticipating redemptive themes

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and judgments are retained without mitigation; Samson’s fall is portrayed with sorrow and shame, not sentimentality.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

Necessity and divine initiative ("kunde ikke naa den uden ved Herrens Haand") preserved with strong modal language.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Udvælgelse – election
* Naade – grace
* Trofasthed – faithfulness
* Trældom – bondage

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Samson asleep in Delilah’s lap retained as vivid moral image
* Hair as sign of election preserved symbolically

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Judgment → hope → renewal maintained distinctly

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Sentence length and cadence preserved to support proclamation.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

But the Lord had not forsaken His people. Though it plunged itself like a prodigal son into the pleasures of the world, the Lord yet also let it taste the bitterness of the world’s bondage; and in need and misery Israel was brought unto the Lord and gained new experience of His faithfulness and grace, when the Lord raised up deliverers for His people who, in the power of the Spirit, led the people to victory and freedom. The judges and their work bear witness that the Lord remained faithful where Israel was unfaithful. The election and the covenant with the fathers stood firm where Israel failed.

But despite the work of the judges and the working of the Spirit of the Lord, Israel declined ever further. And the last judge, Samson, stood entirely alone against the enemies of God’s people. Yes, not only that. Seduced and swept away by Philistine heathendom, inflamed by Samson’s own intemperance, the men of Judah would even bind their champion themselves and deliver him into the power of the enemies. So low had the people sunk through the lust of the world and its bondage. And Samson himself, so great and richly gifted, fell so deeply that sorrow and shame cleave to his name and to his history forever. Samson, ensnared, sleeping with his head in Delilah’s lap while the hair of his head—the sign of his election—was shorn away, so that powerless and helpless he was given into the hands of the Philistines—this is an image of the people of Israel in that time. As Samson renounced his election for the lust of the world and sank strengthless into the hand of his enemies.

But Samson had strength to die for his people; alone, cast off and despised, trampled underfoot and abused, he had not forgotten his people; in the hour of his death his thought and his soul were with the precious, chosen Israel. But there is hope for that people whose sons go into death for it. Thus Israel still had a future before it. Yet it could not attain it except by the hand of the Lord; therefore the Lord sent them the voice of awakening through the mouth of Samuel.
