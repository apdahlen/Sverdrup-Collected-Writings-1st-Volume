STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Aand / Aandens” — must be rendered as Spirit, with biblical-personal force, not abstract “spirit”.
* “Høvdinger,” “Bannerførere,” “Folkeførere,” “Folketalere” — overlapping leadership terms with rhetorical accumulation; avoid flattening into a single English term.
* “skikket” — fitted, appointed, made fit; avoid merely “qualified” in a modern bureaucratic sense.
* “gaa ud for deres Ansigt … gaa ind for deres Ansigt” — idiom with biblical cadence (Num. 27); must retain Hebrew-style imagery.
* “Kjødets og Verdens Tjeneste” — flesh/world as theological categories, not merely immoral behavior.
* “aandsbaaren” — Spirit-borne / Spirit-led, not emotional enthusiasm.
* “flyttet og oprettet” — established, set in order, made firm; not merely relocated.
* “Vidnesbyrd for Retfærd og Uskyld” — juridical/moral testimony; avoid sentimental tone.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with parallel clauses and biblical rhythm.
* Heavy use of semicolons to mark rhetorical progression.
* Embedded Scripture quotations that must not be smoothed or paraphrased.

Theological Hazards:

* Leadership defined strictly by obedience to God’s Spirit, not charisma.
* The Spirit as the decisive criterion for authority.
* Sacrifice of gifts to God as consecration, not loss.
* Renewal of a people without violence as a theological claim.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic, exhortational Lutheran tone addressing conscience.
* Moral weight and gravity must not be softened.
* Evaluative language (“i Sandhed stor,” “kun den”) must retain exclusivity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “følger Aandens Kald” — calling of the Spirit; vocation language rooted in Scripture.
* “giver sig helt hen til Maalet” — total self-surrender; echoes Rom. 12.
* “En Mand, i hvem der er Aand” — direct quotation from Num. 27:18; KJV diction required.
* “gaa ud og gaa ind for deres Ansigt” — idiom for public leadership before the people.
* “Her er jeg, Herre, send mig!” — Isa. 6:8; must echo KJV.
* “lagde … Gaver ned for Herren” — cultic image of offering, not resignation.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: true greatness in God’s people is spiritual obedience, not prominence.
* Scriptural grounding: Num. 27 defines legitimate leadership.
* Expansion: natural gifts can exist without true greatness.
* Contrast: gifts used for flesh/world vs. consecrated to God.
* Exemplum: Samuel as historical embodiment.
* Historical claim: national renewal without violence.
* Moral conclusion: his life is worthy of careful following.
* Transition to historical section: Israel in the time of the Judges.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Num. 27:17–18 explicitly quoted.
* Isa. 6:8 paraphrased.
* Shepherd imagery throughout (Leader and Shepherd).
* Exodus–Joshua narrative assumed knowledge.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain exclusivity: “only the man or woman.”
* Maintain solemn evaluative judgments.
* Preserve weight of national destiny language.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “kun den” / “han alene” — must remain absolute.
* Avoid weakening necessity into preference.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand → Spirit
* Folk → people (capitalized where ecclesial sense is clear)
* Maal → goal / end appointed by God
* Vei → way (biblical resonance)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Shepherd/leader metaphors retained.
* Way/goal imagery preserved.
* Offering of gifts kept metaphorical, not explanatory.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Evaluative severity in leadership criteria.
* Elevated admiration in Samuel section.
* Didactic calm in historical transition.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Semicolon logic retained.
* Avoid chopping into modern short sentences.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

There are great men in Israel, as in every other people; there are chieftains and standard‑bearers; there are leaders of the people and speakers for the people. But in truth great in God’s people is only the man or the woman who follows the Spirit’s calling and gives himself wholly over to the goal which God has appointed for His people. “A man in whom is the Spirit” (Num. 27:18) is the only one who is fitted to be leader and shepherd in Israel; he alone is the man “who may go out before their face and go in before their face, and who may lead them out and bring them in” (Num. 27:17). It is the Lord’s man whose calling it is to behold the Lord’s goal and follow its summons; and only he who himself has walked in the way of the Spirit can go before the people on their way toward the goal set by God.

Great abilities and glorious gifts do indeed make a man eminent in Israel, as among all peoples, even when the gifts are taken into the service of the flesh and of the world; but great in truth is only he who laid the great and glorious gifts down before the Lord and said, “Here am I; send me,” and who thereafter went forth in the Spirit’s power and the Spirit’s light before God’s people, and showed them where the Lord’s way was.

Such a Spirit‑borne leader in God’s people is Samuel. He is one of the few men in history who have been an instrument for the renewal of an entire people, and who, without bloodshed and deeds of violence, were able to gather what was scattered and unite what was divided. At his death Israel stood moved and established; for his own time he saw the people united and strong as never since the death of Joshua. Yea, though such great things had been accomplished and so much had been changed, Samuel could nonetheless step forward and receive from his people a full and complete testimony to righteousness and innocence in his entire public course.

It would be more than worthwhile to follow the struggle and labor of his life for his precious people. The Spirit of God has preserved the chief features of the great man’s life as a testimony for the latest generations.

\subsection{Israel in the Time of the Judges}

In a people that grows in a sound and vigorous manner, there are two powers which often seem to draw each its own way, yet which only when they are united become a true blessing for the people; these are freedom and unity. Israel had been driven together in need and oppression under the Egyptians’ harsh bondage. Moses had led the wretched people out into freedom, and his strong hand and superior might had preserved the people, corrupted by slavery and oppression, from again being split and scattered and thus perishing. Joshua had taken the governance over Israel with dauntless courage and had led it through struggle and distress, through victory and triumph, into the promised land.
