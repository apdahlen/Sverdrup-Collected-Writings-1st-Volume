STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "vildt og raat" – carries moral and spiritual judgment, not merely social disorder.
* "Seders Fordærvelse" / "sedelig Fordærvelse" – moral corruption with strong ethical and theological weight.
* "Vel-lyst" – not neutral pleasure but sinful, unnatural lust.
* "Afgudernes Templer" – includes cultic prostitution implications.
* "Forjættelsernes salige Haab" – covenantal, eschatological hope.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, cascading sentences with sermonic buildup.
* Frequent semicolon logic and cumulative moral argument.
* Parenthetical historical references embedded in exhortation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of divine judgment on moral corruption.
* The concept of remnant faith preserved by God.
* Covenant faithfulness versus assimilation.
* Sexual sin framed as rebellion against God, not merely social decay.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, warning, prophetic tone.
* Exhortational rhythm directed at conscience.
* Risk of modernizing language and weakening moral force.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "steg mod Himmelen om Hævn" – biblical idiom echoing Genesis 18–19; KJV-style "cried unto heaven for vengeance."
* "forbandt sig" – covenantal alliance, not casual association.
* "lade sig sees af Gud" – cultic expression meaning to appear before the Lord.
* "levede af Forjættelsernes salige Haab" – faith sustained by divine promise.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Description of moral chaos in the period of the Judges.
* Reminder of divine warnings through Moses and Joshua.
* Example of Canaanite corruption and divine judgment.
* Israel’s failure to heed warnings and resulting moral collapse.
* Assertion of divine preservation of a faithful remnant.
* Introduction of specific faithful figures leading toward Samuel’s birth narrative.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Genesis 18–19 (Sodom and Gomorrah).
* Deuteronomy and Joshua’s covenant warnings.
* Judges’ recurring theme: moral decay.
* Ruth 1:16–17 in reference to Naomi and Ruth.
* Exodus/Deuteronomy cultic language regarding appearing before the Lord.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

The translation must retain prophetic severity, moral urgency, and solemn warning without mitigation or sentimentality.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maatte" and "kunde ikke" structures retain necessity and inevitability.
* Divine judgment is not hypothetical but certain.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Fordærvelse" → corruption
* "Forjættelse" → promise
* "Gudfrygtig" → God-fearing
* "Vidnesbyrd" → testimony

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Moral corruption as a consuming force.
* Worldly life as devouring.
* Faith as a remaining spark.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severe indictment → sober warning → quiet consolation in the remnant.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional; pauses marked by commas and semicolons.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

\subsection{Samuel’s Birth}

The life of the people in the time of the Judges was in many respects wild and crude. Clearly and solemnly had the Lord admonished His people through the mouth of Moses and of Joshua, that they should not bind themselves to the Canaanite nations. Scarcely is there any people in the world who hastened more swiftly toward destruction through the corruption of morals than precisely the Canaanite peoples. Sodom and Gomorrah fell as the first terrifying example of the Lord’s judgment upon moral corruption and unnatural lust. Yet the punitive judgment did not put an end to the corruption of morals. The cruel and cunning Canaanites united the lust of the world with the wisdom of the world, and their cities, which distinguished themselves by wealth and prosperity, became also the homes of vice and excess, unto which ungodliness ascended unto heaven crying for vengeance. The divine mercy was therefore compelled to cry words of warning to young Israel, which entered into so corrupt a land, where even the temples of the idols had become dwellings of indecency.

But the solemn admonitions did not bear the desired fruit. It was not long before we find the sins of Sodom within the cities of Israel. The Israelite and the Canaanite youth took pleasure in one another’s company. Although there had stood a separation between the older generations of the two peoples, keeping them apart from one another, this separation no longer had the same meaning or the same effect upon the rising generation. The young men of Israel took Canaanite wives, and Israel’s daughters were given in marriage to the Canaanites. The wild, luxuriant life of the world seemed intent on swallowing all and everything.

Yet God had preserved His own. Though the corruption was great and widespread, the spark of faith was not extinguished, nor was the voice of testimony silenced, and the God-fearing life of Israel had not wholly ceased. There were still not only great and chosen instruments of the Lord, but also here and there small and inconspicuous souls who faithfully preserved Israel’s faith and lived by the blessed hope of the promises. There was Naomi, whose faith even drew the heathen woman into God’s people and the truth of His promises. Ruth left Moab, her land and her people, her kindred and her gods; and there was also a man such as Elkanah and his household, who observed the Lord’s commandments and ordinances and year by year went up to the sanctuary to appear before God at Shiloh, where the Tabernacle had stood since the days of Joshua.
