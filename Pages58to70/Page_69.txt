STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Grundidéer" – foundational ideas with philosophical–theological weight, not merely "principles."
* "Frikirke" – not simply a modern "free church," but a church free from state control, often polemically contrasted with Catholicism.
* "Guds Rige" – Kingdom of God; must retain biblical resonance.
* "Naademidlerne" – Lutheran sacramental term (means of grace), doctrinally loaded.
* "Myndighed" – authority in a moral–spiritual sense, not bureaucratic power.
* "optændt Kjærlighed til Magt" – inflamed or enkindled love of power; metaphorical and moral.
* "forføriske Aand" – seductive/deceiving spirit; possibly demonic or worldly.
* "Tilintetgjørelse" – annihilation, not mere decline.
* "Begjær" vs. "Kjærlighed" – sharp moral-theological contrast.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long rhetorical questions chained together; must remain unified.
* Logical progression through conditional reasoning.
* Semicolon logic and cumulative argumentation.
* Sermonic cadence that should not be fragmented.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of salvation through means of grace.
* Authority of truth versus abuse of power.
* Ecclesiology: church as servant of salvation vs. dominator.
* Sinful desire for greatness contrasted with Christian love.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical yet pastoral tone.
* Earnest warning against spiritual corruption.
* Rhetorical force aimed at the conscience.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Guds Rige" echoes biblical language (Matt. 6, Mark 1); natural KJV equivalent: "the Kingdom of God."
* "hæve Sandheden" – to assert or uphold truth authoritatively; KJV-style "maintain" or "assert."
* "rette Naademidlerne" – to direct/administer the means of grace; requires Lutheran precision.
* "tjene Menneskenes Frelse" – serve the salvation of men; echoes pastoral theology.
* "forvandles til sin Modsætning, medens de bevarer sit gode Skin" – classic moral paradox; outward appearance preserved while essence is inverted.
* "Afgrundskløft" – abyssal chasm; metaphor must be retained.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Observation: Catholic Church historically acted on certain foundational ideas.
* Rhetorical questions: Are these ideas foreign to Free Churches?
* Assertion: All Christians must answer yes to these principles.
* Warning pivot: Introduce love of power.
* Consequence: Good principles are perverted into their opposites.
* Example: One Free Church attempting full independence.
* Judgment: Example is discouraging.
* Conclusion: Desire vs. love; only love may guide the Church.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Kingdom of God – Gospel language.
* Truth and authority – Johannine undertones.
* Salvation through means – Acts / Pauline sacramental theology.
* Love vs. desire – 1 Corinthians 13 resonance.
* Abyss imagery – biblical metaphor for radical separation.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp warnings about corruption.
* Preserve moral seriousness and polemical edge.
* Avoid softening critique of Catholicism and Free Churches alike.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must" throughout.
* Rhetorical necessities preserved without dilution.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Frikirke – "Free Church" consistently.
* Naademidler – "means of grace."
* Begjær – "desire."
* Kjærlighed – "love."

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Love of power as a consuming fire.
* Abyss between desire and love.
* Preservation of outward "fair appearance."

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Initial rational inquiry.
* Escalation to warning.
* Final moral–theological conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long interrogative sequences retained.
* Semicolons preserved where possible.
* Readable aloud without flattening.

STEP 11: FINAL ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

In the whole course of the Catholic Church it is these fundamental ideas that have asserted themselves. And are they far removed from any Free Church? Or is it not so, that the Free Church strives for the Kingdom of God, and does it not follow therefrom that it must strive to embrace all men? Is it not so, that the Free Church possesses the truth, and must it not then with authority maintain the truth? Is it not so, that men cannot be saved except through the means of grace which the Church has, and must not the Church therefore seek to direct the means of grace wherever it can, and thereby serve the salvation of men? No Christian dares to answer these questions with anything other than an affirmative Yes.

\textbf{But let there now enter into this one of the world’s foremost, enkindled loves for power and for dominion over the world, and all these things will, by the force of that seductive spirit, be transformed into their very opposite, while they yet retain their fair appearance.}

We know this one Free Church which has sought to develop itself as independently as is at all possible in the world. In reality we know no other. But this example is little cheering; for it seems to show with certainty that the Free Church must end in a complete annihilation of Christianity, just as is the case with Catholicism. For no one knows the frailty of his own heart, and if the desire to become great can lead to such results, where then is the Free Church which, according to all that we can see, does not have and must not have this desire? But the truth of the matter is that there lies an abyssal chasm between desire and love, and only the latter may guide the Church, not the former, if it is to walk on the way toward the Christian community.
