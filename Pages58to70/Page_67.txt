STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Frikirke" – not modern "Free Church" but the early church as institutionally free from the state.
* "Kirkehoved" – implies supreme ecclesial headship, not merely administrative leadership.
* "ren Lære" – doctrinal purity with confessional weight.
* "Overlevering" – apostolic tradition, not casual transmission.
* "Katholik" / "Katholicismens" – denotes universalizing power-structure, not merely indicating Roman Catholic denomination in modern sense.
* "Massekirke" – mass-church formed by political expansion, not congregational vitality.
* "Fordærvelse" – corruption in moral and spiritual-theological sense.
* "Keisermagt" – imperial coercive power, with Constantinian overtones.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with evaluative pivots.
* Parallel contrasts between Rome and Greek patriarchy.
* Sermonic rhythm driven by semicolons and balanced clauses.
* Embedded evaluative metaphors (rock, waters, eagles).

Theological Hazards:

* Authority of doctrine vs authority of conscience.
* Transformation of doctrine into coercive power.
* Distinction between outward belonging and inward faith.
* Mission versus domination.
* Forced baptism and nominal Christianity.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical Lutheran critique of Catholic universalism.
* Earnest warning against spiritual corruption through power.
* Prophetic tone when describing mass conversion and coercion.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "banede Veien" – prepared the way; moral-historical causation.
* "Klippen" – biblical metaphor (Matt. 16), ecclesiological claim.
* "Verdens urolige Vande" – chaos of doctrinal controversy.
* "Hvor Aadslet er, skal Ørnene forsamles" – Matt. 24:28 (KJV phrasing preserved).
* "bøie Knæ" – biblical submission imagery (Phil. 2:10).
* "Begjærlighedens Uro" – restless lust for domination.

KJV-style equivalents are especially suitable for biblical quotations and metaphors.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Need for centralized authority arises in mass-oriented free church.
2. Rome gains prestige through doctrinal firmness and apostolic reputation.
3. Comparison with Greek patriarch strengthens Rome’s authority.
4. Rome becomes doctrinal center; doctrine becomes power.
5. This marks a decisive step toward corruption.
6. Barbarian migrations provide new mission field.
7. Shift from conversion of the world to subjugation of the world.
8. Mission increasingly carried out through imperial coercion.
9. Mass baptism produces outward Christians without inward faith.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 16 – Rock imagery (Peter).
* Matthew 24:28 – Eagles and carcass.
* Philippians 2:10 – Every knee shall bow.
* Acts/Pauline mission contrasts – inward vs outward faith.

Biblical diction should echo KJV cadence where possible.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain polemical sharpness.
* Preserve evaluative judgments ("fordærvelse," "magt," "tvang").
* Retain urgency and moral seriousness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maatte" – must / necessarily had to.
* "skal" – shall (normative and prophetic force).
* "vil" – intentional striving.
* "kunde" – capacity grounded in authority.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "ren Lære" – pure doctrine
* "Magt" – power (not influence)
* "Omvendelse" – conversion
* "Underkastelse" – subjection
* "Katholicitet" – catholicity (as universal dominion)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Rock and waters – preserved metaphorically.
* Eagles gathering – retained verbatim in biblical register.
* Narrow way – moral-spiritual path imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Admiration → warning → lament → critique.
* Missionary idealism contrasted with coercive reality.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentence flow.
* Retain semicolon logic and rhythmic clauses.
* Avoid modern paragraph fragmentation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

And this prepared the way for that which one necessarily had to possess in the free church that desired a great multitude of people and great power over them, namely, a head of the Church who in every respect was ruler and leader.

From ancient times the Bishop of Rome had enjoyed a good reputation for pure doctrine. It was said of the Roman congregation and its bishop that it possessed an apostolic tradition or transmission, so pure and uncorrupted as that of no other. Thither one could go and learn the truth; from thence one could hear the apostolic testimony; from thence the illuminating word was spoken into the many intricate questions of the age. Little wonder, then, if the dignity which the Bishop of Rome possessed, the unshakable firmness with which he held forth the pure doctrine, was compared with the unworthy courtly snobbery of the Greek patriarch and his vacillation in doctrine, as the emperor set the tone. The Bishop of Rome gained by the comparison. He was regarded as the rock against which the restless waters of the world dashed themselves in vain, and as the spiritual successor of the rock-apostle Peter. To him men looked up, and the voice of Rome received decisive weight in the development of doctrine.

The free church had taken a great step forward toward its corruption when pure doctrine had become power, and Rome had become the center of doctrine. It was at once the tradition of the Roman Empire and the struggle against the paganism of the Roman Empire that had brought about this position. But the free church, which had lost its pure ecclesiastical character by becoming a mass church within the Roman Empire, was soon to be enticed still farther from the narrow way by admitting in great numbers the new barbarian peoples who at this time were streaming in over the Empire.

“Where the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together,” rang over the old Empire. New, fresh, and vigorous peoples hewed for themselves bloody paths toward the lands where the old world had unfolded its strength and squandered its life. They seized the strong man’s fortress and divided his spoil. In them the Church received a new mission field. The free church wills the conversion of the world; once it has become half Catholic, it wills the subjugation of the world. All peoples shall bow the knee to Christ—this is the free church’s involuntary lofty goal; all peoples shall bow to the power of the Church—this is Catholicism’s never-abandoned striving, after which it pursues with the restless craving of desire. When the migration of the barbarians began, Rome was still far from having become Catholic; before the new peoples had passed over to Christianity, it had become fully conscious of itself in its striving after catholicity.

It was evident that just as the whole old world had been Christianized, so too the elements of the new world must be Christianized. The Church had learned that this was most quickly accomplished by imperial power. And however many glorious and uplifting images of true Christian mission the Church’s activity among the barbarians may present, it is nevertheless essentially by power and coercion of a new emperor, Charlemagne, that these peoples’ transition to Christianity was effected. Their political subjugation and their baptism en masse were one and the same thing. And the Church once again stood, as at Constantine’s transition to Christianity, face to face with great pagan masses who bore a Christian name. They belonged to the Church outwardly; they did not belong to it with the heart.
