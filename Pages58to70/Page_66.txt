STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Sandhedssøgen" carries philosophical and theological weight beyond simple "search for truth." It implies autonomous rational inquiry.
* "Forstandens anstrengte Arbeide" suggests strained, laborious activity of human reason, not neutral cognition.
* "Autoritetens Vælde" conveys coercive or sovereign power, not mere authority.
* "aabenbarede Sandhed" must remain "revealed truth" in a theological sense.
* "rene Lære" is a technical ecclesial term (pure doctrine), not moral purity.
* "Erkjendelse" here means doctrinal apprehension or recognition, not mere knowledge.
* "Kjættere" must retain the charged term "heretics."
* "Spidsfindighed" refers to scholastic subtlety or sophistry.
* "Orthodoxiens bestandige Grundskade" is a metaphor meaning a chronic foundational defect.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extended periodic sentences with layered conditional clauses.
* Repeated anaphoric "naar" (when) clauses building rhetorical force.
* Semicolon logic and cumulative argumentation that must not be broken.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between God’s revealed truth and the Church’s doctrinal formulation of it.
* The danger of rationalism within orthodoxy.
* The use of human reason as auxiliary versus norm.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical yet sober Lutheran critique of Catholic development.
* Didactic, admonitory tone warning of doctrinal corruption.
* Risk of modern smoothing that would weaken severity and gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "satte ... Guds aabenbarede Sandhed" – to set or oppose revealed truth against pagan culture; echoes apologetic confrontation.
* "den ved, paa hvem den tror" – biblical idiom echoing 2 Timothy 1:12 ("I know whom I have believed"). KJV phrasing is natural.
* "bukkede under for Fristelsen" – yielded or succumbed to temptation; moral-spiritual idiom.
* "omgjerede ... med Fordømmelser" – encircled with condemnations; juridical-ecclesial imagery.
* "høiede af fra Sandhedens enfoldige Vei" – departed from the simple way of truth; pietistic idiom valuing simplicity.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Initial contrast: pagan rational culture vs. churchly revealed authority.
* Legitimation of free church authority grounded in faith.
* Development of pure doctrine as ecclesial recognition, not revelation.
* Temptation to absolutize doctrine with divine authority.
* Success of doctrine’s power through unity, condemnation, and intellectual defense.
* Inherent danger: reason infiltrates doctrine.
* Consequence: gradual alteration of doctrine to fit rational concepts.
* Historical judgment on the Catholic free church’s deviation from simple truth.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 2 Timothy 1:12 – "I know whom I have believed."
* Implicit contrast between divine revelation and human wisdom (1 Corinthians 1–2).
* Imagery of "the way" echoes biblical usage (Acts, Gospels).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain critical sharpness toward ecclesial rationalism.
* Preserve warning against doctrinal corruption.
* Retain sober historical judgment without irony or sarcasm.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa gjøre" – must do; necessity grounded in faith.
* "kunde slutte sig" (editorial note) – can infer; epistemic possibility retained.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* aabenbarede Sandhed – revealed truth
* rene Lære – pure doctrine
* Fornuft / Forstand – reason / understanding
* Kirken – the Church

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Doctrine as something defended, encircled, infiltrated.
* Reason as a foreign helper that works its way inward.
* Orthodoxy having a chronic foundational defect.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Confident assertion → critical warning → historical lament.
* Editorial note retains modest, explanatory tone distinct from main text.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences suitable for public theological discourse.
* Maintain cumulative rhythm of repeated clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Directly over against the heathen world of culture and its natural quest for truth through the strained labor of the understanding, the Church set, with the might of authority, God’s revealed truth. Every free church must do this; for it knoweth whom it hath believed. Yet it did not stop there. In the course of time it fashioned the pure doctrine, which was not God’s revealed truth itself, but the Church’s recognition of the revealed truth. It was this pure doctrine of the Church which the free Church had the most natural temptation to endow, against the heretics, with the authority of God’s Word. It succumbed to the temptation. And when the Church surrounded its pure doctrine with sufficient condemnations, and when, with its bishops, it gathered itself together in unanimous agreement thereon, and when it did not refrain from taking to its aid the whole of antiquity’s human learning and subtlety in order to defend the pure doctrine, which still contained enough of the divine truth to stand over against reason, then thereby the power of doctrine over the old cultural world was established. But the doctrine itself was thereby exposed to the same danger which is orthodoxy’s abiding fundamental defect. Human reason is taken as a helper in order to defend the doctrine, in order to render the doctrine clear and explicable, at last even in order to prove the doctrine. A foreign aid is taken, and it works itself little by little into the doctrine itself, which must undergo small and slow changes in order to fit the concepts of reason. Thus it was that the Catholic free Church for a time maintained itself, in order to preserve God’s truth, in order to hinder the influence of heathendom, but departed from the simple way of truth to the way which leads — — — —*
