A historical personality may be viewed from different sides. It may be seen in the light of the conditions and surroundings that outwardly condition its appearance in history. Or it may be seen in the light of the aptitude for a particular life calling, recognized through abilities and education. Finally, it may also be seen in the light of the efforts undertaken to attain a certain goal, to solve a particular task.

Taken together, these three elements constitute the complete and full presentation of the personality from a historical point of view, while at the same time casting light upon the complex of spiritual currents and labors upon which the life in question has exerted both transient and lasting influence.

If we then look—if only at the titles—at the written works that are here before us from Professor Sverdrup’s hand and mind, we immediately gain the impression that we are standing face to face with a man who occupies himself exclusively with solid questions and tasks, both principled and practical. His spirit pressed downward and inward to that which acts as a driving force in the life of the Church and the congregation; or else to that which, as a historical result, revealed itself to his spiritual clarity of vision as a determining factor in the development of life, and from the recognition of which he never shrank back; or again to that which stood before his spirit as an ideal—radiant and full of promise, yet bearing within it the full content of prudence.

In this way I believe I have indicated what constituted the essential distinguishing mark of his rich intellect. He could never rest in the mere outward fact; rather, from that—which served as the given material for thought—he sought to return to the very essence, to the principle. And in this tireless search to find not only the true interconnection of things, but also their logical development from a principle firmly grounded in life, his entire scholarly orientation was revealed—one that was in all essential respects dialectical, that is, the method of Socrates as presented in Plato’s writings. How he admired the sharp, incisive, ironic quality of Socratic thinking—the truth-content recognized by its own keen observation, built upon an uncompromising and prejudice-free gaze!
