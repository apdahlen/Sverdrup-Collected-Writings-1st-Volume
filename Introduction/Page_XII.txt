The second difficulty is that what in reality is the significant, the essential, and the characteristic element in a person is concealed or pushed into the background by that which the person in question happens, at the moment, to need most. Professor Sverdrup stood, to a high degree, like many of the Lutheran Church’s contending men, under both of these difficulties—despite a sober historical sense and a sound and just judgment of his person built upon it.

The remarkably brief introduction to Professor Sverdrup’s Selected Collected Writings is an answer to a request that I write such an introduction, made to me by the publisher of the work, Professor Andreas Høiland, who himself, in his introductory remarks to the individual sections, has touched upon several points that properly belong to a biography, and whose clear and perceptive view of Professor Sverdrup’s person and work will, to a considerable degree, help the untrained reader toward a more distant and comprehensive understanding of his life and the work to which he devoted it.

The publication of the work will moreover serve a twofold purpose: first, to refresh the memory of the man to whom the Lutheran Church in America owes so much; and second, to preserve for the congregation, in a more accessible and familiar form, the writings in which he set down the fundamental views upon which his entire ecclesiastical and popular work rested.

For the reasons mentioned in my first biographical attempt, it is still too early to write a biography of Professor Sverdrup that can place his life and his work in their proper historical context and apply the correct historical measure.

The purpose of this brief introduction is therefore only to emphasize what is essential in Professor Sverdrup’s work, especially as it emerges over time in his posthumous writings, which in themselves form the most beautiful and enduring memorial of him.
