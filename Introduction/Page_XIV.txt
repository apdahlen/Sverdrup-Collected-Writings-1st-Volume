Richly endowed by nature and developed through the study of Greek philosophy—which he had assimilated in an entirely original way—he was thereby fitted, as few are, to untie historical knots and to cast light upon historical life, which his spirit sympathetically lived through and absorbed in the fullest measure. Thus his presentation gained life and color, in that he himself lived along with everything he depicted. It would be difficult to find a more intimate balance between subjective and objective understanding and presentation.

But although he was scientific in his pursuit of truth, and although he possessed a rare power of exposition, he was nevertheless far too much of a fighting nature to settle into a purely formal recognition of truth or into a barren, dogmatic comprehension of results already attained. He did not merely work with the truth; the truth worked within him. And thus, in accordance with his entire temperament, he ranged beyond forms and formulas until he stood freely above the whole spiritual battlefield, where, like a field commander, he brought his heaviest artillery forward at the point where he saw the position most urgently required it. People easily misunderstand such a man. And if he is placed within what are commonly called “small” circumstances—where one must struggle against ingrained prejudices, where people’s narrower influences and self-interests render both friends and enemies, both supporters and opponents, cowardly, malicious, and wavering—then a rare strength of character is demanded, an almost unceasing vigilance, in order not to turn aside from the path once perceived as the one true way. Professor Sverdrup suffered under the difficulty of such a position to the same degree as many others who are endowed by nature with rare gifts and are called by God to wage the struggle of personality for truth and justice against complacency and class hatred, against indifference and self-interest.

And should one seek a clear, unmistakable testimony to the intensity with which he perceived this position of struggle, and at the same time to the clarity and sharpness of thought with which he was able to present his view, one could scarcely find anything better than the following brief piece, discovered among his papers and which was either a draft for a speech or an outline for a longer article. Any commentary is entirely superfluous. It is, however, fairly likely that he wrote this at a relatively young age. Both style and handwriting bear witness to that.
