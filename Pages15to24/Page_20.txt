STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Fromhed" / "Fromhedens eget Præg" – pietistic piety with moral-spiritual coloration; must not be reduced to generic religiosity.
* "Hjertets skjulte Menneske" – biblical phrase (1 Pet 3:4); requires KJV-like rendering.
* "Strømhed" – childlike purity/guilelessness; archaic nuance.
* "Forligelse" – reconciliation/atonement language; doctrinal precision required.
* "Raadløshe(d)" – moral-spiritual impotence, not mere confusion.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, chained sentences with sermonic cadence; avoid breaking into short modern clauses.
* Parallelisms and semicolon logic that carry rhetorical force.

Theological Hazards:

* Sanctity of the sanctuary; priestly office; atonement through sacrifice.
* Distinction between outward blamelessness and inward spiritual blindness.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, exhortational Lutheran tone; address to conscience.
* Moral gravity must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "En Lovsang som Hannas" – Hannah’s song (1 Sam 2); implies authentic praise born of grace.
* "Hjertets skjulte Menneske" – 1 Peter 3:4; inner spiritual character.
* "Herrens Redskab" – instrument chosen by God; vocational calling.
* Sanctuary imagery draws on Levitical theology.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening: Samuel’s formative home shaped by Hannah’s piety.
* Contrast: expectation of holiness in the sanctuary.
* Reversal: corruption and desecration by the priests.
* Culmination: Eli’s failure and the ruin represented by his sons.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Hannah’s Song – 1 Samuel 2.
* Inner man – 1 Peter 3:4.
* Body imagery – 1 Corinthians 12.
* Priestly blessing – Numbers 6.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain severity in judgment of priestly corruption.
* Preserve reverent admiration of Hannah’s faith.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa have været" – must have been; retain necessity.
* "skulde" – divine purpose and obligation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Helligdom – sanctuary.
* Aand – Spirit.
* Velsignelse – blessing.
* Forsoning / Forligelse – atonement / reconciliation.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Light, body, flow, growth metaphors retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Sharp contrast between home and sanctuary.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and rhythmic flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Samuel had already in his home seen much of the good powers at work in the life of the people of Israel. There must have been peace and joy in his mother’s quiet homestead; and the blessing she had experienced must surely have rested upon her whole life with thankfulness, and have laid piety’s own imprint upon her entire being. A song of praise such as Hannah’s does not well up from a false and impure heart, nor does it overflow from light-minded lips. The hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, must assuredly have been this woman’s adornment. And Samuel, without knowing it, bore within himself the woman’s inheritance from the mother who hoped in him to behold the Lord’s instrument for the awakening of the people.

It is all the more grievous, with this thought of Samuel’s home, to pass over to the consideration of the ungodliness with which Samuel was to become acquainted in the Lord’s sanctuary. For from there the light of holiness and the life of love ought indeed to have streamed forth over the little people, who now by their spiritual strength were to raise their standing in relation to the mighty heathen nations that surrounded them on every side. From the sanctuary the Lord’s truth and the Lord’s Spirit should have gone out to all the scattered members of the congregation and bound them together into a living body. The bloody sacrifices were to be signs of atonement and reconciliation for the sinful people, while the priest’s blessing was to follow them back into their daily labor and lay the Lord’s power into their work. There, thought Hannah, the little Samuel must surely grow up amid pure and holy surroundings, where the child-heart’s guilelessness and innocence would not be disturbed by the many temptations that a coarse popular life brought with it.

But it was not so in the Lord’s sanctuary. Defiled and profaned was the house of God by those who were the Lord’s priests and who by their calling ought to have been the light of the people. Old Eli himself had been a man of somewhat blameless conduct in his dealings. But stripped of the Spirit’s power, and blind to the Lord’s holiness and the people’s need, he had not been able to stem the tide against the ever-growing corruption among the priests. His own sons became representatives of this spiritual decay in its most grievous embodiment.
