STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Gjerning" – carries biblical-theological weight (work, act within divine economy), not merely "task".
* "aandelig Vækkelse" – pietistic revival language; must not be psychologized.
* "Uselt" / "ringere" – moral-spiritual abasement, not merely social decline.
* "Forfængelighed" – vanity with biblical resonance (Ecclesiastes).
* "berede det Kraft" – divine bestowal/preparation of strength.
* "Reformator" / "Reformation" – theological-historical weight; not modernized to generic reform.
* "Huusholdning" – divine economy, governance, dispensation.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, paratactic sentences with semicolons expressing sermonic flow.
* Repeated future constructions expressing prophetic certainty.
* Embedded metaphors (lion, hero of Judah) within extended clauses.

Theological Hazards:

* Revival as divine act, not human initiative.
* Judgment and salvation held together, not separated.
* Maternal prayer as efficacious before God.
* Reform as both destruction and renewal within God’s economy.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone.
* Elevated sermonic rhythm.
* Biblical imagery that must not be flattened or paraphrased.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Slag paa Slag" – idiom for repeated victories; KJV-style "blow after blow".
* "raaber til Himlen" – Genesis-style cry to heaven (cf. Gen 18–19).
* "Nedrivelse og Opbyggelse" – Jeremiah 1:10 resonance.
* Maternal dedication echoes Hannah narrative (1 Samuel 1–2).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Prophetic preview of Samuel’s role.
* Hannah’s faith as interpretive key.
* Power of maternal prayer.
* Transition to judgment theme.
* Theology of reformation: corruption → judgment → salvation.
* Application to Israel under Eli.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Hannah’s song – 1 Samuel 2.
* Lion of Judah – Genesis 49.
* Cry to heaven – Genesis 4; 18.
* Judgment day – prophetic literature.
* Building and tearing down – Jeremiah.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* No softening of judgment language.
* Maintain prophetic certainty and gravity.
* Preserve pastoral seriousness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skulde" – rendered as "should" / "was to" with prophetic force.
* Necessity and divine inevitability retained.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Reformation – consistently retained.
* Judgment / Salvation paired throughout.
* Spirit / Light language kept stable.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Lion imagery preserved.
* Maternal sacrifice not explained away.
* Crying, longing hearts kept figurative.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Hope (Hannah) vs. Judgment (Eli’s house).
* Consolation and terror held together.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved.
* Semicolon logic retained.
* Proclamatory rhythm respected.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

But Samuel was to be the instrument of a like work. Israel’s people were to experience a spiritual awakening, which should transform both its inward and its outward condition. Base as Israel already was, it was to be brought yet lower. That which had become its pride and its vanity it should lose; yet in its uttermost need the Lord would prepare strength for it through Samuel’s prayer. Then Israel, trampled down and crushed beneath its enemies, should rise up in the strength of its God and strike its foes back, blow after blow. As a lion should the Hero of Judah step forth against the enemies of God’s people, and in shame should they retreat before him.

Such was Hannah’s bright hope and faith when she brought the heavy sacrifice of leaving Samuel behind at the sanctuary, while she herself departed quietly on her way. Were there more mothers like Hannah, there would also be more sons like Samuel.

For a mother’s prayer availeth much; and Samuel, who was dedicated for his whole life with tears and with jubilation, should not put to shame the hope that was bound up with him. Of life he as yet understood only life’s sorrow and life’s joy; but there are dreams in the hearts of children which no one understands, and there are moments that make indelible impressions upon the young. Such a moment it must surely have been for the little boy, when his mother’s holy enthusiasm shone upon him, and when he saw her so glad and so deeply moved. He may well have remained behind with childlike sorrow and fear; and yet he may also have forgotten his childish dread in the Lord’s sanctuary, where he was left alone.

\subsubsection{The Judgment upon the House of Eli}

By Hannah’s song of praise Samuel was consecrated to be a reformer in Israel. Yet a reformation has its preparation through long ages of abuse and spiritual deadness. When the commandment and the guilt in the existing order reach a certain boundary, and when corruption advances so far that it cries to heaven for vengeance, then the day of the Lord comes with crushing judgment upon the old. But reformation is not merely judgment upon the reigning corruption; it is also salvation and deliverance for that which has lain sighing and longing for the Lord’s light and the life of the Spirit. Therefore a reformation has not only its negative preparation in ancient obstinacy and stiffening injustice; it has also its positive preparation in a people through the cry of oppressed and persecuted hearts for salvation, through longing for deliverance, through hope of brighter and better times. Judgment and salvation, destruction and upbuilding, go hand in hand in the Lord’s householding with His people; and it was not to be otherwise on this occasion.
