STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Varsel" (warning/omen with prophetic weight)
* "bebødede" (solemnly announced, proclaimed by divine commission)
* "vanæret" (dishonored, profaned)
* "Vellevnet og Vellyst" (self-indulgent luxury and sensual pleasure)
* "Lønbroddets Skyld" (for the sake of hired bread; mercenary subsistence)
* "Forfærdelse" (holy dread, not mere fear)
* "Vanhelligelsen" (profanation of what is holy)
* "Aabenbarelse" (revelation, divine self-disclosure)

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with causal chains and moral pivots
* Parallelisms and antithetical contrasts (what priests were vs. should be)
* Embedded biblical diction and prophetic cadence

Theological Hazards:

* Judgment vs. covenant continuity (Eli’s line not extinguished, but humiliated)
* Priesthood as divine trust vs. human corruption
* Prophetic calling as obedience to God’s voice
* Divine justice as defense of God’s honor

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational gravity and moral severity
* Childlike purity as moral authority
* Prophetic urgency without sentimentality

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Dommen sig nærmede" echoes prophetic judgment language (cf. KJV cadence).
* "Tigge og trygle" intensifies humiliation beyond simple begging.
* "Raabende i Ørkenen" directly echoes Isaiah 40:3 / John 1:23.
* "Lægge sit Øre til hans Mund" conveys intimate attentiveness to God’s speech.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Moral cause: profanation of priesthood
* Consequence: reversal of honor into shame
* Preparation of Samuel through moral contrast
* Samuel’s calling as prophetic listener
* God’s revelation begins with judgment
* Anticipation of unexpected fulfillment of God’s counsel

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Samuel 2–3 (judgment on Eli; call of Samuel)
* Isaiah 40:3 (voice crying in the wilderness)
* John the Baptist typology
* General prophetic themes of divine justice

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain severity of judgment
* Preserve solemn prophetic tone
* Avoid psychological softening

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skulde" rendered as "should" / "would" with necessity
* Divine determination kept firm and unavoidable

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Priesthood, judgment, revelation, honor/shame used consistently

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Wilderness cry
* Bread as symbol of humiliation
* Mirror imagery of the child’s soul

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Judgment contrasted with calling
* Severity contrasted with faithful obedience

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional
* Semicolons used to preserve sermonic flow

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Over the house of Eli the judgment drew near. The Lord did not leave him without warning. A prophet announced to Eli that the wrath of the Lord would come upon him and upon his lineage. If the priesthood had dishonored the Lord, then He would cause shame and disgrace to come upon the priesthood. That which He had set highest in the people of Israel, and made the true bearers of the whole of Israel’s spiritual life, He would cast down into the deepest contempt and misery. The house of Eli would not die out; yet a faithful priest would take his place, and the wretched descendants of Eli’s house would beg and implore him for a priestly office, that they might obtain a piece of bread to eat. As the sons of Eli had transformed the Lord’s holy priestly office into a means of self-indulgent luxury and sensual pleasure, so in return the descendants of Eli would be made to experience the full bitterness of having to beg for a priestly office for the sake of hired bread. Eli himself was to behold the sign of this wretched future: his two sons would die in one day.

As Samuel grew, the rising contrast between what the priests were and what they ought to have been must have presented itself in sharp and glaring light to his childlike mind. There is nothing for which a child has a keener eye than hypocrisy and falsehood. None is more authoritative than a faithful and God-fearing child; and as the clearest mirror bears witness to every glance and desire in a human soul, so a child’s soul, the purer and nobler it is, becomes all the more offensive to every form of dishonesty in its surroundings. With ever-deepening dread Samuel beheld the profanation of the Lord’s sanctuary. Thus he was being prepared for the Lord’s first revelation to him; for that revelation was to be a new warning of judgment upon the house of Eli.

Three times the Lord called to Samuel before Samuel, at Eli’s bidding, answered: “Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth!” Yet this was not only spoken from the depths of the young heart; it became as a constant and unceasing cry from Samuel’s inmost soul throughout his entire subsequent life. Faithful, and even grave as he was, it became the earnest striving of his life to be open and receptive to the Lord’s voice, to lay his ear to His mouth, to listen to His speech by day and by night, that he might become for his people a voice of the Lord, crying in the wilderness. As John the Baptist went before the Messiah, so Samuel went before the reign of David and Solomon with the cry of awakening. Samuel’s first vision was a message of death over the house of Eli. Thus it was that the Lord would first reveal Himself in this time. With judging righteousness He would strike down that which was set in high station among His people; for His honor was violated by the ungodliness of the priests, and the people were led into dreadful paths by those who should have been its leaders. Yet no one could well have foreseen in what strange manner the Lord would bring His counsel to fulfillment.
