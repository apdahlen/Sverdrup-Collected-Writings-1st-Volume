STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Pagtsarken – covenantal, biblical term; must be rendered as “the Ark of the Covenant,” retaining sacral weight.
* Udvortes – outward, external, often pejorative in pietistic theology.
* Aandforladte – spiritually lifeless, not merely careless.
* Vanhellige – profane, sacrilegious.
* Elendighed – misery, wretchedness in a theological sense.
* Herligheden – glory, likely echoing the kavod of God.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with semicolon logic.
* Parallel constructions contrasting joy/fear, outwardness/inwardness, death/birth.
* Embedded causal clauses (“thi …”).

Theological Hazards:

* Judgment (Dom), grace through judgment, transition from old Israel to new.
* Misplaced trust in outward signs vs. living faith.
* Priesthood corruption and divine holiness.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic, grave, exhortational tone.
* Strong evaluative language that must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Herren vilde holde Dom” – judicial action of God; KJV resonance: “the Lord would judge.”
* “bortvegen er Herligheden” – echo of Ichabod narrative (1 Sam. 4:21).
* Birth pangs and death imagery – biblical motif of judgment giving way to new life.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Narrative introduction: Ark brought from Shiloh.
* Fear among Philistines due to memory of Exodus.
* Theological interpretation: God’s judgment against superstition and corruption.
* Historical judgment: Ark captured, Eli’s house destroyed.
* Climactic symbol: death of Phinehas’s wife and naming of Ichabod.
* Conclusion: death of old Israel, birth of new era through Samuel.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Exodus narrative (God’s power over Egypt).
* 1 Samuel 4 (Ark, Eli, Phinehas’s wife, Ichabod).
* Psalmic future through David.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain severity of judgment and solemn hope.
* No sentimental softening of suffering or death.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “skulde faa sin fortjente Løn” – must receive its deserved recompense.
* “vilde holde Dom” – intentional divine action.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Dom – judgment
* Herlighed – glory
* Pagtsark – Ark of the Covenant

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Birth/death imagery preserved literally.
* Seed imagery for Samuel’s word retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From terror and collapse to quiet, embryonic hope.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences maintained where rhetorically necessary.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Israel fetched the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh. With jubilation and joy it was received; with fear and terror the Philistines heard of its coming. Israel’s God had so mightily revealed Himself in Israel’s exodus from Egypt that the memory thereof still lived on among the heathen nations; and the Philistines feared that mysterious power which had once been so dreadful to mighty Egypt.

But the Lord would hold judgment. Heathen superstition, idolatrous reliance upon the outward sign of the covenant, the spiritually lifeless priesthood, and the profaned house of Eli were to receive their deserved recompense. The way was to be prepared for that spiritual knowledge of God which, through Samuel’s awakening word, would fall as living seed into the hearts of the people and bring forth the noble fruits that lie before us in David’s Psalms. From the coarsest outwardness to the deepest inwardness the way led only through a fearful judgment of the Lord.

The Ark of the Covenant was taken by the Philistines. It was a shattering blow to Israel’s hollow worship of God. Their confidence and their strength were gone. The sons of Eli fell. Eli himself perished, unstrung\footnote{The Danish 'gjennemrystet' means 'shaken through.' The term 'Unstrung' is used to reflect the total collapse of Eli’s physical and spiritual frame at the news. — Present Ed.} by the horror of the calamity.

The mighty day of judgment ended with a heart-rending event which gathered into itself, as in a mirror image, all the features of Israel’s misery. The wife of Phinehas was seized by terrible birth pangs at the tidings of disaster that came from the battlefield. She breathed out her life amid the agony and called her son’s name Ichabod; for, said she, the glory has departed from Israel, for the Ark of God is taken.

The woman dying in childbirth, who seems to see all as lost, yet gives a son life in her hour of death. Thus sinks old Israel, the old time, into death, when the Ark of the Covenant and the priesthood are in one day trampled to dust; but a new Israel and a new time stand at the door; for the Lord lives, and Samuel is His Spirit-bearing instrument. As yet the new time is only as a newborn child, yes, as a child stirring in the womb\footnote{The Danish 'uroligt Foster' literally means a 'restless fetus.' In this homiletic context, 'stirring in the womb' captures the hidden, internal nature of God’s new work before it is visible to the world. — Present Ed.} in the eyes of men; but in its time it shall be seen that salvation and redemption sprout from the soil of judgment.
