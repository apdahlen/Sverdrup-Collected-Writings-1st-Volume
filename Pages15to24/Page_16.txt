STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Silo" refers to Shiloh, the cultic center; retain biblical resonance.
* "Horn" (Horn) as a metaphor for strength and exaltation; must not be literalized away.
* "Frelse" bears salvific, covenantal weight beyond generic rescue.
* "Helligdommen" implies the sanctuary/tabernacle, not a generic holy place.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with cumulative clauses must not be fragmented.
* Parallel poetic lines in the hymn require preservation of balance and cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Vows, dedication, divine gift and return to God; must preserve theology of grace and consecration.
* God’s sovereignty in life, death, abasement, and exaltation.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn narrative transitioning into exalted hymnody; modernization would flatten intensity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Landets Lys og Styrke" is metaphorical for the child as hope of Israel.
* "Høit er mit Horn" echoes biblical idiom of exaltation (cf. KJV diction).
* The hymn closely parallels 1 Samuel 2; KJV phrasing should guide English.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Narrative movement: journey → presentation → recollection of vow → hymn.
* The hymn proclaims reversal theology: God overturns human strength and weakness.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Direct echo of Hannah’s Song (1 Samuel 2:1–8).
* Anticipatory echo of Mary’s Magnificat (Luke 1).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain awe, joy, and prophetic force.
* No sentimental softening of divine sovereignty.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and divine action (“must,” “does,” “brings”) retained strongly.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Lord, salvation, strength, raise up / cast down used consistently.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve horn, bow, rock, grave imagery intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Narrative tenderness contrasted with triumphant hymn.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Poetic lines retain rhythmic balance suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

The day came when Samuel must go with her to Shiloh. The light and strength of the land followed Hannah, and she went with joy along that road which she had so often before imagined as painful and heavy. To Shiloh, to the sanctuary, to Eli went the little company; and the least in that company was to become the greatest in the people of God. With deep and inward emotion Hannah stepped forward before Eli, and now Eli learned what Hannah had prayed and vowed on the day when she had spoken so bitterly and poured out her soul before the Lord. There stood Samuel, granted by the Lord; now he was to be presented back to Him.

But Hannah prayed again—not a prayer of pain as on that former day of sorrow, but a prayer of praise and joy, such as only one woman after her has sung. A song of praise the Spirit of the Lord laid upon Hannah’s lips, which was to resound again with unspeakable joy from the mouth of the mother of Jesus:

Glad is my heart in the Lord;
Exalted is my horn in the Lord;
My mouth is opened wide against mine enemies,
For I rejoice in thy salvation.

There is none holy as the Lord,
For there is none beside thee;
Neither is there any rock like our God.

Speak no more exceeding proud words;
Let not insolence come out of your mouth;
For the Lord is a God of knowledge,
And by him actions are weighed.

The bows of the mighty are broken,
And they that stumbled are girded with strength.

They that were full have hired themselves out for bread,
And they that were hungry hunger no more;
Yea, the barren hath borne seven,
And she that had many children languisheth.

The Lord killeth, and maketh alive;
He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.

The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich;
He bringeth low, and lifteth up also.
