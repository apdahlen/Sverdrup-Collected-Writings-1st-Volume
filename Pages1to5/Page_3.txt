STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “stemnede” (mustering/summoned for battle; not merely ‘appointed’)
* “Helt” (hero/champion with moral-spiritual overtones)
* “Seier” (victory as providential success)
* “Prydt” (ornament/glory, not decoration)
* “Ryst” (delight/joy with emotional warmth)
* “Kæmpe” (giant/champion, biblical combatant)
* “Tvekamp” (single combat, formal duel)
* “Haanede / spottede” (covenantal insult against God)
* “Helvedestanke” (hellish thought; diabolical insinuation)
* “Kongepryd” (kingly adornment/true royal qualification)

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with sermonic cadence
* Biblical narrative pacing that must not be modernized
* Accumulative clauses joined by “og” (and)

Theological Hazards:

* Divine election (“Herrens Udvalgte”)
* Faith as kingly qualification
* God as shield and defender
* Envy as diabolical corruption

Voice Hazards:

* Elevated, homiletic tone
* National-covenantal language
* Poetic metaphors that must remain vivid

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “sat sit Hjerte til Herren” – idiom for covenantal devotion (cf. Deut. 6)
* “i Israels Guds Navn” – acting under divine authority (KJV resonance)
* “Herrens Aand kom over ham” – Judges/Samuel idiom for divine empowerment
* “Herren til sit Skjold og Værge” – Psalmic imagery (Ps. 18)
* “Vandbække, der mødes i Dalen” – metaphor for spiritual affinity and providential union

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Introduction of Saul and Jonathan as hopeful royal figures
* Crisis: Goliath’s challenge and Israel’s fear
* Divine reversal through David’s faith
* Public rejoicing contrasted with Saul’s inward corruption
* Climactic spiritual union of Jonathan and David

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Samuel 13–18 narrative framework
* Goliath episode (1 Sam. 17)
* Songs of the daughters of Israel (1 Sam. 18:7)
* Psalmic metaphors of shield and refuge

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain solemn, exalted narrative tone
* Preserve moral contrast between Saul and Jonathan
* Retain exaltation of faith over worldly power

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity implied in divine election and response
* Avoid weakening providential causality

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* “Herren” → “the LORD”
* “Tro” → “faith”
* “Udvalgte” → “the Chosen / the Elect”

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Shield imagery
* Water-brooks metaphor
* Shepherd-boy contrast

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Joy vs. envy
* Faith vs. fear
* Light vs. creeping darkness

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long clauses and rhythmic flow
* Preserve proclamation-ready diction

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

At this time the Philistines went up against Israel, and Saul summoned the host against them. And Saul had a son whose name was Jonathan, and he was a hero in war, and victory followed him against the Philistines, for he also had set his heart upon the LORD, and in the name of Israel’s God he smote the enemies of Israel. Among Israel’s heroes Jonathan was the flower, an ornament unto Israel, a joy and delight to the people of God. He was the king’s son, and the people rejoiced in hope of the day when he should sit upon his father’s throne.

Then came the great champion of the Philistines, the mighty Goliath, and set himself forth to single combat. And he reviled the armies of Israel, and he mocked their God, and there was none who dared to meet him. Fear and dread lay upon the whole host of Israel; but David was not among them, for he went about upon the fields of Bethlehem and kept his father’s flock. Yet he also would behold the Philistine champion, and he went to the camp; and the Spirit of the LORD came upon him. With a sling in his hand and smooth stones from the brook in his shepherd’s pouch, he went against the champion in the name of God. And against the champion with sword and spear he set the LORD as his shield and defender, and the Philistine fell before the despised shepherd-boy of Israel.

Then there was jubilation in Israel, then the daughters of the people sang with gladness the praise of David. But a dark and hellish thought crept into the heart of Saul; envy seized him, and bitter hatred toward David, because the LORD had chosen him and given him the strength of faith, which was the true kingly adornment among the people of the LORD. But the heart of Jonathan opened itself toward the unknown shepherd-boy; his heroic spirit rejoiced in the heroic deed, his faith was strengthened by David’s boldness of faith; he recognized the LORD’s Chosen and loved him. And as brooks that meet in the valley, gently and silently glide together and cast themselves into one another’s embrace, unable to do otherwise, so heart was bound to heart and soul to soul, when Jonathan and David found one another on the day of victory.
