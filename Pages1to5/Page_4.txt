STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

Saul’s hatred and persecution brought, from that day onward, tribulation and distress upon David. It was the Lord’s school of love, wherein the chosen king was to be prepared to become a true ruler of people and land. Thus, driven from the king’s court, threatened with death, hunted from place to place like a wild beast, he no longer had any home, any resting place, save in the Lord’s faithfulness and in Jonathan’s friendship.

Jonathan sheltered him from danger; Jonathan warned him against his father’s cruelty; Jonathan went to him in the forest and strengthened his hand in God. Jonathan defended him before his father, so that Saul, even in his fury, hurled his spear at his own son.

Was there anything for Jonathan to gain by such faithfulness to his persecuted friend? On the contrary, it seemed as though there was everything to lose. There were many bonds that surged against this love and would have quenched it, yes, even turned it into bondage to Saul. Temptation lay on every side for Jonathan to give way; yet in all things he was found faithful.

Saul, his father, was rejected by the Lord, and David was chosen in his stead. David was to receive Jonathan’s inheritance; the son was to lose all because of the father’s sin. Envy and wounded vanity might well have gathered bitterness in Jonathan’s heart; yet his friendly mind remained at peace with this thought: David shall be the first in the kingdom, and I shall stand at his side.

Jonathan was the pride of Israel; now a shepherd boy was to go before him. He who had gone foremost in Israel’s wars was to give way to one who had gone behind the bleating sheep. It seemed a bitter thought, but Jonathan found rest in the confidence that the Lord chooses whom He will to prepare His people.

Daily Saul’s kingdom declined; daily Jonathan had to see faithfulness to Saul give way to the growing sympathy for David. David’s nobility cast a heavy shadow over Saul’s faithless course. Jonathan felt how it cut through the heart to see his father overwhelmed with shame; yet in all this he prevailed.

And David, who was hunted and persecuted, who was not deemed worthy to have even a cave in the land where Saul had his throne—his soul too was surely tempted to hate both father and son. He must have feared what Jonathan would do when Saul was dead. He might well have thought it better that the whole house of Saul were destroyed, if he were to have peace upon Israel’s throne. There was temptation when he saw Jonathan alone and himself despised; there was temptation when he met him alone in the field, alone in the forest. Might he not think: “This is the heir; if he is gone, then the struggle is ended at Saul’s death”? Yet in all this David prevailed.

Then came the final battle. The Philistines attacked Israel; Saul and Jonathan went out against them. Alone the friend went with his blinded father. He fought for the rejected one; he himself had nothing to gain thereby. For David’s land fought Saul’s son; for Saul’s victory fought David’s friend. But David was not at his side. The tumult of slaughter increased, and the struggle grew fierce; Jonathan fell in the unequal fight. But David’s lament has borne Jonathan’s name unto this day: 

\quote{I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.}

Why did Jonathan fight, why did David suffer? For Israel’s hope, which was greater to them than their own honor. Thus the Lord bound hearts together in unbreakable friendship and rock-fast faith for His people and its hope.
