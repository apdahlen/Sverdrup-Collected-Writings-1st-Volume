STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Konventikelplakat – a specific 1741 royal ordinance; must not be generalized as merely a "law against meetings".
* Lægfolket / Lægprædikanter – laypeople / lay preachers with strong ecclesial-theological nuance.
* Tugt-ningsarbeide (Slaveri) – penal labor; must retain severity, not softened.
* Gudelige Forsamlinger – pietistic term; more than “religious meetings.”
* Godtykke – arbitrary clerical discretion, not mere permission.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long historical sentences with causal chains.
* Parenthetical clauses carrying essential historical detail.
* Passive constructions expressing institutional force.

Theological Hazards:

* Guds Sag – not generic “cause,” but God’s cause.
* Lægprædikanters Virksomhed – spiritual calling vs. civil offense.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical and moral judgment ("ugudelige Lov," "berygtede Forordning").
* Honorific closing sentence; must retain gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “drevet denne Sag igjennem” – idiom meaning forced through by persistence.
* “død og begraven” – rhetorical finality, not casual idiom.
* “rejste sig med Kraft” – collective moral uprising.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Contrast between other reforms and this repeal.
* Historical explanation of the ordinance’s infamy.
* Demonstration of continued threat post-Hauge.
* Popular resistance vs. governmental hesitation.
* Parliamentary struggle and final victory.
* Moral commendation of Ueland.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* No direct quotations, but strong biblical diction: suffering for God’s cause; memory followed by honor.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain condemnatory language toward the law.
* Preserve admiration for Hauge’s suffering and Ueland’s courage.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “truede altsaa fremdeles” – must retain ongoing threat.
* “vilde vel … men kun paa Betingelse” – conditional resistance.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Gudelige Forsamlinger – consistently “godly assemblies.”
* Lægprædikanter – “lay preachers.”

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Law as threat; memory followed by honor; burial metaphor.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Historical narration → moral judgment → triumphal closure.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve extended sentences and emphatic final clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

Different was the case with the repeal of the Conventicle Ordinance. It was the lay people who forced this matter through.

This Conventicle Ordinance of the 13th of January 1741 has become so significant in the history of the Norwegian Church, because it was by virtue of it that Hans Nielsen Hauge was arrested, held in prison for ten years, and finally sentenced to pay 1,000 riksdaler in fines and legal costs, after the lower court had first sentenced him to two years of penal labor (slavery) together with the costs of the case.

This same law, under which Hauge had been convicted in 1813, thus continued to threaten all lay preachers in Norway after his time. Yet so much had Hauge’s sufferings for God’s cause accomplished, that after his time there was great reluctance to bring the law into application against his successors. The law was also somewhat ambiguous; for it did not outright forbid “godly assemblies,” but restricted them to consist of “a few” only, and made them entirely dependent upon the clergy’s arbitrary consent.

Against this ungodly law the Norwegian church people rose with power and demanded its unconditional repeal. But the government, and a considerable number of the clergy, indeed wished the old law repealed, yet only on condition that a new law concerning godly assemblies should be put in its place.

Twice, in 1836 and in 1839, the Norwegian Storting resolved that the Conventicle Ordinance should be unconditionally repealed. Both times the King interposed his veto. In order then to set the matter upon a new track and avert a total defeat, the government resorted to its customary expedient of appointing a royal commission to draft a new law concerning “godly assemblies.” This commission consisted of Professor of Theology J. K. Dietrichson, District Judge Sørensen (who later died as a Councillor of State in 1853), and Pastor W. A. Wærles. And this commission did in fact prepare a new law concerning godly assemblies and the activity of lay preachers, which was presented to the Storting on the 7th of March 1842.

But it was too late. Five days earlier the well-known Ole G. Ueland, who was undoubtedly strongly seized and brought forth by the Haugean revival, had already introduced a proposal for the unconditional repeal of the Conventicle Ordinance. This proposal, which was also recommended by the chairman of the Church Committee, Pastor J. L. Arup, passed. It was the third time; and with that the notorious ordinance of the 13th of January 1741 was thus dead and buried. Imperishable honor follows Ueland’s memory for this.
