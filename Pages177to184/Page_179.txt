STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Medhjælper" — not merely assistant, but subordinate helper in a mission context.
* "alvorligere Gemytter" — older moral-psychological term meaning serious or earnest minds.
* "gudelige Forsamlinger" — pietistic term with legal-historical weight; not generic meetings.
* "Dissenterloven" — specific statute; requires formal legal rendering.
* "Konventikelplakat" — technical ecclesiastical ordinance; must not be paraphrased loosely.
* "fri Religionsøvelse" — freedom of religious exercise, not abstract freedom of belief.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long historical sentences with legal enumeration and embedded clauses.
* Passive constructions describing legislative outcomes.
* Semicolon-style legal logic requiring preservation of flow.

Theological Hazards:

* Concepts of God’s Kingdom, religious labor, conscience-bound conviction.
* Distinction between freedom within vs. outside the state church.

Voice Hazards:

* Measured but earnest historical-theological tone.
* Risk of flattening solemn narrative into neutral modern historiography.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "arbeide for Guds Riges Sag" — biblical-pietistic idiom meaning active service for the cause of God’s Kingdom (cf. Matt. 6:33).
* "efter bedste Overbevisning" — conscience-bound conviction, echoing Protestant conscience theology.
* "fri-sindede Forfatning" — liberal constitution; must retain ironic tension in context.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Narrative opening: Schreuder’s departure.
* Introduction of parallel struggle: religious freedom.
* Legal-historical exposition of two related questions.
* Central claim: true religious freedom was lacking despite constitutional ideals.
* Documentary correction: original wording of Paragraph 2.
* Concluding contrast between original and altered constitutional text.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Kingdom of God language (implicit New Testament echo).
* Conscience and obligation motifs resonant with Romans 14.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sober seriousness without polemics.
* Preserve implicit moral weight of constitutional manipulation.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "forbliver," "er forpligtede," "maa ikke taales" — must retain full legal necessity and prohibition.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Religion" → Religion
* "fri Religionsøvelse" → free exercise of religion
* "Statskirke" → State Church

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* No extended metaphors; preserve juridical imagery and struggle language.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Narrative calm vs. implicit critique.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain longer sentence structures suitable for public reading.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

It was on the 1st of July 1843 that Schreuder, together with a helper, Thomassen, went aboard the ship which was to carry him away from his fatherland to England, from whence he intended to proceed to Cape Town.

\subsubsection{The Struggle for Religious Freedom}

Meanwhile, another struggle was also being fought, one which stirred no small agitation in the more serious minds in Norway.

This was the struggle concerning religious freedom in the general sense, and the particular freedom, within the Lutheran State Church, to hold what were called “godly assemblies.”

The one question was resolved by the Dissenter Act of the 16th of July 1845, and by the Act concerning the admission of Jews to the Realm of the 24th of September 1848. The other question was resolved by the Act of the 27th of July 1842, which repealed the so‑called Conventicle Ordinance of the 13th of January 1741.

Both of these matters were in part treated and considered simultaneously, as there is indeed a close kinship between them. For in reality the question concerns the freedom to labor for the cause of God’s Kingdom according to one’s best conviction, whether within or outside the State Church. This freedom, namely, was not present in Norway, despite its liberal Constitution.

In this connection, however, an item of information must be communicated which is far from being as generally known as it ought to be. Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, which deals with “the State’s public religion,” did not originally read as it is now to be found in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway. The original form of Paragraph 2, as it was originally adopted by the Constituent Assembly at Eidsvold, read as follows:

“The Evangelical‑Lutheran Religion shall remain the State’s public Religion. All Christian religious sects shall be granted free exercise of religion; yet Jews and Jesuits are still excluded from the Realm. Monastic orders shall not be tolerated. The inhabitants of the country who confess themselves to the State’s public Religion are obliged to raise their children in the same.”

This paragraph, which was drafted by the County Governor B. F. R. Christie, was adopted by 94 votes out of 111. But when the Constitution as a whole was read aloud and finally adopted, Paragraph 2 had in an incomprehensible manner been altered, so that the entire sentence concerning free exercise of religion for all Christian sects had been completely omitted. And none of the men of Eidsvold took notice of this, for it was too late. And Paragraph 2 of the Constitution read in this new form as follows:

“The Evangelical‑Lutheran Religion shall remain the State’s public Religion. The inhabitants who confess themselves to it are obliged to raise their children in the same. Jesuits and monastic orders shall not be tolerated. Jews are still excluded from admission to the Realm.”
