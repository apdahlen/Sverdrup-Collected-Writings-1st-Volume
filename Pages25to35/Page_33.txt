STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Torden" used emphatically (repeated) with biblical portent, not mere weather.
* "forfeildt" (forspildt) implies irrevocable squandering of divine future, not casual loss.
* "Fremtid" carries covenantal-historical weight.
* "redelig Gudsfrygt" denotes sincere, upright fear of the Lord, not generic piety.
* "egenraadigt" and "gjensstridigt" signal willful autonomy against God’s command.
* "Afsind" here means spiritual derangement, not mental illness in modern sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, flowing sentences with semicolon logic and rhetorical buildup.
* Narrative-theological transitions must not be flattened.
* Direct speech embedded within exposition requires preserved cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Covenant faithfulness vs. disobedience.
* Divine rejection of Saul as judicial act, not emotional reaction.
* Obedience vs. sacrifice (core biblical theology).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, solemn, sermonic tone addressing conscience and history.
* Narrative gravity must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* Thunder and rain in wheat harvest echoes 1 Samuel 12:16–18, a sign of divine judgment.
* "The thought struck like lightning" evokes sudden conviction of sin.
* Prayer "that we die not" reflects covenant fear of divine wrath.
* KJV parallels strongly suited for quoted speech.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Divine sign confirms Samuel’s warning.
* People convicted, repentant, plead for intercession.
* Samuel consoles with promise of divine faithfulness.
* Transition: Samuel’s mission partially fulfilled.
* New problem: Saul’s failure in obedience.
* Culmination: prophetic judgment against Saul grounded in theology of obedience.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Samuel 12:16–25 (thunder, rain, repentance).
* 1 Samuel 15:22–23 (obedience better than sacrifice).
* Covenant formula: "The Lord forsaketh not His people."

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain severity of judgment and sorrow of rejection.
* Do not soften prophetic rebuke.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kunde ikke gaa" rendered as moral impossibility.
* Divine rejection stated definitively.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Lydighed" consistently as obedience.
* "Herrens Ord" as the word of the Lord.
* "Forkastet" as rejected.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Lightning, thunder, harvest preserved literally.
* Spiritual disorder rendered vividly.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Shift from terror to consolation, then to tragedy.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and rhetorical flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Then as thunder upon thunder and rain in the time of wheat harvest unexpectedly accompanied Samuel’s profound address, it became too much for the people. Had they truly forfeited their whole future? That thought struck their soul like lightning. And in distress and supplication they turned to Samuel: “Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.”

And Samuel could then speak words of consolation—“Fear not!”—to the anxious people. Despite all disobedience, there should yet be a way of salvation for Israel; for the Lord forsaketh not His people.

Thus Samuel’s immediate aim was attained. The people went forward into the new age, which with the kingdom was to dawn upon them, with a God-fearing mind and a bowed heart.

But Samuel’s labor was not ended. Israel had received a king, and Israel had bowed itself under the word of the Lord and accepted the king in sincere fear of God; yet the king himself did not long remain obedient to the Lord. Saul’s exaltation had come too swiftly; there was no corresponding humility in his soul. His first victories emboldened him, and instead of simple humility beneath the word of the Lord, he began to act willfully and in defiance. This could not be. That vigorous natural disposition, which through the Spirit of grace might have become so great a blessing to the people, became ungovernable and reckless in its frenzy. Samuel was compelled to make the grievous journey to Saul and proclaim to him that the Lord had rejected him:

\begin{quote}
Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry; because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, He hath also rejected thee from being king.
\end{quote}
