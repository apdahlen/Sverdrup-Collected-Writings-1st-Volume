STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Beslutning – carries judicial-final weight; must be rendered as irrevocable divine determination, not mere choice.
* tung-sindig / bedrøvet – more than sad; connotes spiritual heaviness and prophetic grief.
* Trængsler / Prøvelser – theological trials, not generic difficulties.
* uundgaaelige – absolute necessity under divine providence.
* Tugtelse – disciplinary chastisement, not punishment.
* aandelig Lærdom – spiritual instruction formed through suffering.
* Korsets og Tornens Vej – fixed pietistic metaphor with Christological resonance.
* ophøiet / foragtede – reversal motif, echoing Scripture.
* Forsættelsens Folk / Forsættelsens Aand – covenantal promise language.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with semicolon logic and rhetorical layering must remain intact.
* Sermonic cadence relies on accumulation, not brevity.
* Parallel constructions (“en Mand som…”) must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Divine rejection and election (Saul vs. David).
* Suffering as necessary formation for glory.
* Kingship under God, not self-glorification.
* Covenant vocation: Israel as blessing to the nations.

Voice Hazards:

* Prophetic solemnity and pastoral gravity must not be modernized.
* Lament and consolation are tightly interwoven.
* Exhortational tone addressing conscience and history together.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Det skulde gaa saa let” – idiom meaning God would not allow an easy, untested path.
* “Korsets og Tornens Vej” – evokes Christ’s suffering; parallels Matthew 16 and Acts 14:22.
* “ophøies og hovmode sig” – elevation leading to pride; moral-theological warning.
* “en Trøster for de elendige” – pastoral-royal ideal; echoes Psalms and Isaiah.
* “Forsættelsens Folk” – covenant people; Genesis 12 resonance.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Divine decision against Saul is final; Samuel grieves.
2. The necessity of trial for Israel’s future glory.
3. Failure of first kingship as spiritual instruction.
4. Principle: the way to glory is the way of the cross.
5. Need for a new king formed through suffering.
6. Divine election of David as reversal of human expectation.
7. David’s enduring spiritual kingship and blessing.
8. Consolation granted to Samuel through David’s election.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Samuel 15–16 – Saul’s rejection and David’s anointing.
* “the way of the cross” – Luke 9:23.
* Blessing to all peoples – Genesis 12:3.
* The lowly exalted – 1 Samuel 2:7–8; Luke 1:52.
* David as comforter – Psalms tradition.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain gravity of divine judgment.
* Do not soften the tragedy of Saul.
* Preserve the hope-filled solemnity surrounding David.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “vilde ikke” – must not be weakened to preference.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Trængsler – afflictions / tribulations.
* Forsættelse – promise.
* Aand – Spirit.
* Herlighed – glory.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve cross/thorns imagery.
* Maintain reversal of lowly/exalted.
* Keep kingship as pastoral shelter imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Move from grief → discipline → hope → consolation.
* Do not flatten emotional progression.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long periodic sentences retained.
* Parallel clauses preserved for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

It was the final and unshakable decision, and despite all Saul’s pleadings, the matter stood by this word. Samuel went home, heavy of heart and sorrowful, and he did not see Saul again until the day of his death. It had been a hard blow for the prophet, who so gladly would have seen the people spared the new trials and afflictions which were now unavoidable. But the Lord would not have it go so easily. There was a great and glorious future awaiting Israel; yet no great age is ever born save through great tribulations. The first attempt at kingship failed, and however grievous it is to behold a people’s joyful expectations so swiftly shattered, there lay nonetheless in this chastisement a spiritual lesson for the nation: it was to gain a deeper insight into the mystery that the way of God’s people to glory is a way of the cross and of thorns. Both Israel and Saul had striven too lightly and too hastily up to the heights, and they had lost a serious apprehension of the Lord’s cause, in that they thought only of their own honour.

The Lord therefore had to choose a new man to be king, a man who in the hard school of suffering could learn to know his own heart and his God better than Saul; a man who, bowed beneath the cross, could grasp Israel’s high calling without being exalted and puffed up with pride; a man who by the Spirit of the Lord could go before Israel’s people and lead it forward on its way toward the promised goal of becoming a blessing to all nations. Samuel was to anoint David to be king after Saul. And once more it was the lowly who was exalted, and the despised who was taken into honour. And never has there been any earthly king who, like David, became a comforter of the wretched, a refuge time and again for the persecuted, a blessing to peoples in the most distant lands. Truly, a king for the people of the promise and in the spirit of the promise was the little David of the house of Jesse from Bethlehem. And had Samuel done only this one thing— in the clarity of the Spirit to go to Bethlehem and anoint the great Psalmist-king, whose songs were to resound in the hearts of hundreds and millions—Samuel would be reckoned among the greatest in the history of God’s people. And it has surely been, despite all the sorrow Samuel endured in his latter days over the fate of the poor, demented, and hardened Saul, an unspeakable consolation to him that David was the Lord’s chosen, and that great promises followed him of brighter and better days for Israel.
