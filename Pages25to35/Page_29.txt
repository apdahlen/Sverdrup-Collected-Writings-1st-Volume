STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* kjødelige Trang – fleshly, carnal desire; theologically charged.
* synligt Hoved – visible head; ecclesiological resonance.
* finde sig deri – submit, acquiesce under divine necessity.
* bie – wait with patience and purpose.
* Tidens Fylde – biblically loaded (cf. Gal. 4:4).
* Mandens Rige – not generic humanity, but the messianic kingdom of the Man.
* Uforstand – spiritual folly, not mere ignorance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, hypotactic sentences with theological pivots.
* Conditional clauses expressing submission to divine will.
* Sermonic cadence that must not be broken into short modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Divine kingship vs. earthly monarchy.
* Providence, patience of God, and eschatological timing.
* Misunderstanding of spiritual calling.
* Pedagogical use of historical suffering.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, reflective, sermonic tone.
* Moral gravity and submission to God’s inscrutable will.
* Risk of flattening exhortational and pastoral weight.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Og Samuel bad til Herren” – biblical narrative formula; echoes 1 Sam. 8:6; KJV-style diction required.
* “Tid til at bie endnu i tusind Aar” – idiomatic hyperbole expressing divine patience.
* “hilse den med tillidsfuld Forventning” – faith-filled anticipation, echoing Heb. 11 language.
* “lade sig belære af Ordet” – refusal of instruction by God’s revealed word.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Samuel acts cautiously, recognizing historical gravity.
* Decision belongs to the Lord alone.
* Divine patience contrasts with human impatience.
* God permits Israel’s will as pedagogical judgment.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain solemn reflection and moral seriousness.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Konge / Kongedømme – King / Kingship.
* Rige – Kingdom.
* Herren – the LORD.
* aandelige – spiritual.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Waiting for the kingdom as dawn of time’s fullness.
* Earthly kingship as schooling through disappointment.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Samuel’s sorrow vs. God’s compassionate patience.
* Glory of David and Solomon vs. humiliation of later kings.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences with balanced clauses.
* Maintain sermonic rhythm suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

But Samuel did not act hastily or unreflectively in this matter; for he saw that a turning point had been reached in Israel’s history, and that the decision on this occasion would become of far-reaching significance for the whole future. “And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.” It was the LORD who must here give the answer, upon whose will everything depended. If He would allow that the people’s fleshly craving for an earthly king and a visible head should be satisfied, then Samuel must needs submit himself thereto. And if the LORD had time to tarry yet a thousand years before the kingdom of the land with the infinite King should be established upon the earth, then Samuel must also be content to behold the hope of the promise lying far off, and greet it with trustful expectation.

And so it came to pass. The LORD had greater compassion for Israel’s frailty than Samuel. All human impatience to behold at once the kingdoms of the Earthly Realm established was far from Him who knew so well that the time had not yet come; yet surely and calmly the fulness of time would dawn, when the kingdom of heaven with its divine Lord should be set up upon the earth. While the LORD waited, the people should have their will, and learn that though the earthly kingship might indeed accomplish much that was good, it was nevertheless not the true form of life for the people of God. And this new disappointment should prepare Israel for the kingdom of the Man, which the LORD in His own time would establish.

Therefore Samuel received the answer that the will of the people should be done. For although their desire was a misunderstanding of their spiritual calling and a rejection of the LORD, who was their rightful King, yet the people had not advanced in spiritual understanding, and they must learn by painful experience, since they would not suffer themselves to be instructed by the Word. And the LORD would take even this folly into His service, and cause rich spiritual instruction to flow to the people both through the glorious beginning of the kingship under David and Solomon, and through its lofty fall and humiliation under their successors.
