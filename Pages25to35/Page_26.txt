STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The Philistines knew of no other counsel than to send the Ark of the Covenant back again. Fear and terror had seized them, and they were compelled to seek to avert the wrath of Israel’s God from their land. The conquered Israel was, by the power of its God, mightier than the victorious Philistines. Thus the Ark of the Covenant was sent home again in a wondrous manner; yet to the childless tabernacle at Shiloh it never returned. The Ark found no dwelling until David brought it into the new tabernacle which he raised on Zion, and from there it was at last carried into the temple which Solomon built.

Meanwhile Samuel labored in the backslidden and oppressed Israel. With hope against hope he must surely have struggled through the long twenty years that passed before he could once more gather Israel for battle against the oppressors. Yet the hand of the LORD was with him, and his prayers and cries did not meet deaf ears. Wretched Israel, the poor and misguided people, was nevertheless still the LORD’s chosen, and the light of the promises was not extinguished.

Scripture is silent concerning this activity of Samuel; yet from its results we dare judge it, for a people does not rise from bonds and chains of slavery unless strong spiritual powers renew its heart and mind. And Scripture bears witness that after the course of twenty years all Israel went sighing after the LORD. Truly, Samuel cannot have been inactive, nor can his labor have been unfruitful. And what had been accomplished in secret and in stillness was soon to be gloriously revealed.

There was a mighty contrast between that day when Israel, defiant and proud, took the Ark of the Covenant with them into battle and treated the LORD as an idol, and this day, twenty years later, when Israel, broken and penitent, cast away its idols at Samuel’s word. And surely Samuel must have rejoiced in the Spirit on this great day of his life, when he summoned Israel to Mizpah, there to meet its God. With repentance in their hearts and confession of sin upon their lips, the diminished people gathered around their intercessor Samuel. Such a day a people does not experience many times. The people of God experienced once more a manly awakening, and unity and freedom were the fruits of that man for the people.
