STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "mandig" – carries sense of manly firmness, courage, moral resolve; not merely "manly" in a gendered sense.
* "tilværks" – idiomatic: to set about, to proceed decisively.
* "Folkeforsættet" – collective resolution or determination of the people; not a casual wish.
* "Tidens Fylde" – theologically loaded, echoing Gal. 4:4; must not be weakened.
* "forhaanden" – at hand, imminent.
* "knurrende" – murmuring, grumbling; biblical resonance.
* "salvedes" – passive divine action; sacramental overtones.
* "ring" – lowly, humble, insignificant.
* "Fyrste" – prince/ruler with theocratic connotation.
* "Alvorstanke" – seriousness of soul, moral gravity.
* "Afgjørelse" – decisive turning point.
* "biede" – waited patiently.
* "aabenbaret" – revealed, manifested.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with causal and temporal layering.
* Semicolon logic reflecting sermonic flow.
* Passive constructions implying divine agency.
* Embedded evaluative clauses that must remain intact.

Theological Hazards:

* Rejection of God as invisible King.
* Divine election of the lowly.
* Change of heart as act of God.
* Coming of the Spirit.
* Kingship "after God’s heart".
* Providential interpretation of political events.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest historical-theological narration.
* Moral seriousness without sentimentality.
* Avoid modern psychological flattening.
* Preserve prophetic authority and gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "mandig satte sig imod" – stood firmly, courageously against; cf. prophetic resistance.
* "Herren føre sit Folk ind i en ny Periode" – salvation-historical framing.
* "Tidens Fylde" – Pauline biblical idiom (Gal. 4:4).
* "forkastet den usynlige Konge" – theocratic rejection; echoes 1 Sam. 8.
* "Gud forandrede hans Hjerte" – divine regeneration or empowerment; cf. 1 Sam. 10:9.
* "Herrens Aand kom over ham" – standard OT phrasing; KJV resonance essential.
* "mere end nok" – rhetorical understatement emphasizing divine sufficiency.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Samuel’s initial resistance to kingship.
* His obedience once divine purpose is understood.
* Saul’s lowly origin and divine election.
* Saul’s inner transformation and promise.
* Israel’s continued guilt despite divine concession.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Herren = the LORD
* Aand = Spirit
* Konge/Fyrste = King/Prince (theocratic sense)
* ring = lowly
* Folk = people (collective covenantal body)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Historical narrative carries implicit metaphors of guidance, preparation, revelation.
* Do not flatten "Periode af Udvikling" into secular progress.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Samuel’s reluctance vs. obedience.
* Saul’s obscurity vs. sudden elevation.
* Israel’s guilt vs. divine patience.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long, rolling sentences preserved.
* Clause rhythm suitable for oral proclamation.
* Avoid breaking sentences unnecessarily.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

And even as manfully as Samuel had set himself against the desire of the people when he first heard it, so firmly and earnestly did he now set about the carrying out of the people’s resolve, when he understood that in this manner the LORD would lead His people into a new period of their development, in order thereby to prepare them for that fulness of time which Samuel believed already to be at hand. The aged prophet did not withdraw himself dissatisfied and murmuring; but freely and vigorously he laid hold of the events which he would rather had never come to pass.

Saul was anointed king. From the lowly tribe of Benjamin, from the smallest tribe in Benjamin, himself an unknown and insignificant man, he was by Samuel known and acknowledged as the one whom the LORD had chosen to be prince over His people. It was in accordance with the LORD’s wondrous rule, that what is lowly and of no account in the eyes of men, the LORD has chosen. Samuel spoke long and earnestly with the young man, who until then seems not to have harbored any serious thought in his soul. The solemn hour of the anointing became a decisive turning point in Saul’s life; God changed his heart, and the Spirit of the LORD came upon him at the meeting with the prophets. Saul seemed destined truly to become a king after God’s own heart.

Samuel assembled Israel; he once again set before them that they had rejected the invisible King, who had so mightily saved and helped them before. Yet this brought about no change in the people’s decision, and the casting of lots decided who was to be king over God’s people. Saul was taken.

As yet there was no one who truly knew what dwelt within him. He was soon to have opportunity to show it. And Samuel waited, until Saul was thus revealed and made known to the people, before relinquishing his office as judge. The Ammonite king Nahash mocked one of Israel’s cities, and Saul gathered with haste, wisdom, and courage of Israel's men of valor, and within seven days he had an army in the field of three hundred and thirty thousand men, more than enough to bring to naught Nahash’s barbarous threat.
