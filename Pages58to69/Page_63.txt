STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hedensk" / "Hedenskabet" – not merely "pagan" in a neutral sense, but the entrenched religious-cultural system of classical polytheism opposed to Christianity.
* "Aandskraft" – spiritual-moral animating force, not mere "energy".
* "Statsreligion" – carries ecclesio-political weight; must not be flattened.
* "Centralmagt" – centralized authority, both spiritual and institutional.
* "statstjenende Stilling" – serving the state; implies subordination.
* "Frikirken" – the church as free from state control; anachronistic rendering must be avoided.
* "Byzantinisme" – a polemical theological-historical term, not a neutral descriptor.
* "Kjødets" – Pauline term (“the flesh”), not merely physicality.
* "Fordærvelse" – corruption, decay, ruin; moral-spiritual destruction.
* "Raadhed" – moral dissolution, licentiousness, corruption.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, multi-clause sentences with cumulative argumentation.
* Heavy use of semicolons and causal chains that must not be broken into short sentences.
* Parenthetical theological clarifications embedded in the prose.
* Rhetorical questions driving the argument forward.

Theological Hazards:

* Church–state relations and the nature of God’s Kingdom versus earthly power.
* Conscience ("Samvittighed") as a Lutheran theological category.
* Orthodoxy versus heresy defined by imperial authority.
* The nature of persecution, coercion, and true faith.

Voice Hazards:

* Strong polemical tone against state-controlled Christianity.
* Earnest moral warning that must not be softened.
* Sermonic cadence addressing the reader’s conscience and judgment.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "give sit Rige en ny Aandskraft" – idiomatic for revitalizing a failing empire through spiritual means.
* "tage Kristendommen under sin Beskyttelse" – implies patronage and control, not mere tolerance.
* "Despotiets stærke Arm" – vivid metaphor for coercive political power.
* "Kjødets" – Pauline idiom (cf. Romans 8; Galatians 5), best rendered as "the flesh."
* "Guds Rige" – must echo KJV diction (“Kingdom of God”).
* "Keiserens Tro var Lov og Regel" – idiom for enforced belief.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Roman Empire’s adoption of Christianity fundamentally altered the Church’s nature.
* Historical setup: Constantine’s political motives and relocation of the capital.
* Initial Christian reaction: joy and optimism.
* Emergence of Byzantinism: definition and structure.
* Apparent advantages: power, protection, unity.
* Inherent corruption: loss of true spiritual freedom and identity.
* Consequences for people and empire: hypocrisy, violence, barbarism.
* Universal condemnation: orthodoxy does not redeem Byzantinism.
* Climactic warning: danger of heretical emperors coercing the entire Church.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* "Kjødets" – echoes Pauline flesh/spirit dichotomy (Romans 7–8).
* "Guds Rige" – Kingdom of God (Synoptic Gospels).
* Freedom of conscience – implicit Reformation-era reading of Christian liberty (Galatians 5:1).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain uncompromising critique of church–state fusion.
* Preserve moral severity in describing corruption and bloodshed.
* Maintain rhetorical force in warnings and conclusions.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skulde" / "maa" constructions retain necessity and inevitability.
* Hypotheticals ("Hvis nemlig Keiseren var Kjætterisk") must remain stark and forceful.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Kirke" – Church
* "Rige" – Kingdom
* "Keiser" – Emperor
* "Kjætter" – Heretic
* "Samvittighed" – Conscience

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Empire/Kingdom imagery must remain intact.
* The Church as a body corrupted by worldly power.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Early optimism contrasted with later disillusionment.
* Apparent strength versus hidden decay.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences suitable for proclamation.
* Maintain rhythmic buildup toward warnings.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

The imperial realm of Rome was heathen. It was so thoroughly interwoven with heathendom that when the Emperor Constantine, in the fourth century after Christ, deemed it necessary to impart to his empire a new spiritual vitality by taking Christianity under his protection and seeking to make it the religion of the state, he at the same time found it politically prudent to provide his realm with a new capital in Constantinople. The new spiritual central power which Christianity was to become required a new temporal center. From Constantinople the Roman Empire was to be reshaped in Christian form, and Christianity was to assume the same state-serving position which heathendom had formerly held.

It was not without joy that all Christians heard of the Emperor who had become a Christian. All alike saw in this a new victory for Christianity, and many Christians even looked with gladness upon the new power which Christianity now received, since it had the strong arm of despotism upon which to lean; and in faithfulness to the truth we must add that some Christians zealously gave their approval to Constantine’s efforts to transform the free Church into a state Church. The many and powerful heresies which were just then breaking forth were to be warded off by the state Church. Thus arose that peculiar form of church polity which, after the ancient name of Constantinople, is called Byzantinism. This is the name for that system of church government in which the Emperor is the possessor of all power in the Church because he is so in the State, and in which the faith and doctrine of the Church are determined according to the Emperor’s or the court’s whim, or, at best, according to political prudence.

This system had its attraction, in that the Church thereby at once became a kingdom, which indeed was the same as the imperial realm, yet nevertheless bore the name of the Kingdom of God. It had its attraction for the flesh, in that the Church at once obtained power over her enemies and could persecute the persecutors and punish the heretics. But it had this corruption within itself, that the kingdom was no longer in truth the Kingdom of God; that the Church had acquired worldly power and worldly interests; that the Church was no longer herself nor her own ruler. And it brought with it this corruption for the people, that consciences were no longer free, but that the Emperor’s faith was law and rule for the people. From this followed the fullness and the hypocrisy which increased within the Greek Empire and made it what it now is: a home of barbarity and bloodshed, of bondage and brutality.

And these dangers and this devastation followed whenever the Emperor was orthodox, right-believing; and it shall be the curse of Byzantinism everywhere, that it destroys both Church and people, both land and realm, be it as orthodox as it will. But for the Church there came in Byzantinism yet another danger besides. For if the Emperor was heretical—what then? Then the whole Church, or the whole people (for Byzantinism makes no distinction between the two), must change its faith and be converted to the Emperor. This was a danger which one may perhaps have forgotten in the first enthusiasm, but which the Byzantine emperors were soon to make sufficiently evident to all who had earnest concern for the Church.
