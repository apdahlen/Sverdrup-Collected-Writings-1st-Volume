STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "kirkelige Omraade" — broad ecclesial sphere, not merely institutional changes.
* "Skitse" — modest genre term; should not be inflated.
* "Søderland" — affectionate term for Norway; needs dignified rendering.
* "Ottiaarene" — the 1880s; must be clarified idiomatically.
* "aandelige Livsudvikling" — spiritual life-development; theological biography.
* "Menighedens Vei" — ecclesiological commitment, not generic choice.
* "Frikirken" — technical Lutheran term (Free Church), must be consistent.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with concessive and temporal framing.
* Parenthetical clarifications and em dashes indicating editorial voice.
* Embedded quotations from editorial notices.

Theological Hazards:

* Evaluation of high-church vs. low-church identity.
* Spiritual vocation, faithfulness unto death.
* Definition and self-understanding of the Free Church.

Voice Hazards:

* Calm historical correction without polemic excess.
* Reverent tone when speaking of final testimony and death.
* Editorial authority (“— Udg.”).

* Paragraph 3: Introduction of the fifth piece as a compressed parallel; publication history and editorial disclaimer.
* Paragraph 4: Explanation of the final piece, circumstances of its writing, and its testamentary character.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

There have naturally occurred several changes in ecclesiastical matters in Norway since 1886, both with respect to the people as a whole and to individual men. This must necessarily be borne in mind when reading this otherwise exceedingly interesting sketch. Thus the author’s characterization of Bishop Heuch is entirely correct and very apt for the period with which it is here concerned. But in his later years Heuch became quite another man. The extremely high-church parish pastor of Kristiania and editor of the “Lutheran Weekly” later became one of the most low-church bishops Norway has ever had. Yet viewed from the point in time at which these “Reminiscences from Norway” were written, they present a particularly apt picture of the ecclesiastical situation in our old country in the middle of the eighties, as well as an understanding portrayal of the development during the period under consideration.

“Reminiscences from Norway” also form an important contribution to the understanding of Professor Sverdrup’s own spiritual development. When we have read through these pages, we gain some sense of the significance of the struggles through which he himself must have passed in his youth, and of how he also came to establish with spiritual clarity his resolve to choose the way of the Congregation and faithfully to follow it unto his dying day.

As a — though certainly very condensed — parallel to “Reminiscences from Norway,” the fifth piece is then added, “The Norwegian Lutheran Church in America.” In the briefest possible form, and with particular regard to the work of the Seamen’s Mission, the author has here given the French Lutherans a portrait of our people’s ecclesiastical position in this country. The piece was written for the French Lutheran church paper “Le Témoignage” and was thereafter published in translation in the Norwegian paper “Vestlandsposten,” which accompanied it with the following editorial note: “This interesting portrayal has been written by Professor Sverdrup at the request of the French Lutherans’ paper ‘Témoignage,’ from which the article has been translated for ‘Vestlandsposten.’ As readers will observe, it is the history of the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America which he here unfolds for us in brief outline, and it is not a contribution to the controversy being waged on that subject; this is merely mentioned, and that in a manner which will hopefully give offense to no side. — Ed.”

The final piece in this section, “The Lutheran Church,” was written by the author shortly before his death. Concerning this, the then chairman of “Kristen,” Pastor C. C. Smith, has given me permission to relate the following: Early in the spring of 1907, Pastor Smith was requested by the Census Bureau in Washington, D.C., in his capacity as chairman, to submit a report concerning “The Lutheran Church.” At that time he was suffering from a prolonged illness which for months rendered him almost entirely unfit for work, and he therefore requested Professor Sverdrup to write the portion of the said report which was to deal with the principial aspect of the “Free Church” and its work. This request he met with his customary readiness, and it is this report which is here presented in Norwegian — not, however, in translation, but from the author’s own hand, since he had written it both in English and in Norwegian. It gains increased interest from the fact that it is Professor Sverdrup’s final word on what, in his view, the “Free Church” is and ought to be. In this respect, this little sketch may be said to constitute his testament. — Publisher.
