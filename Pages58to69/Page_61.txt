STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Frikirke" – carries 19th-century ecclesiological meaning (church independent of state), not merely "free church" in modern voluntarist sense.
* "katholiske" – refers to the Roman Catholic Church, with historical-theological weight.
* "Overhøihed" – implies supremacy or sovereignty, not mere influence.
* "Kjættere" – heretics, with strong biblical and confessional connotations.
* "Blodvidner" / "Baalvidner" – martyrs by blood / by fire; archaic devotional terms.
* "Kirkeveien" / "Afvei" – metaphorical theological path, not literal road.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, multi-clause sentences with semicolon logic.
* Parenthetical clarifications embedded mid-sentence.
* Rhetorical escalation across sentences that should not be broken apart.

Theological Hazards:

* Ecclesiology: church–state relations, freedom vs. supremacy.
* Antichrist language used polemically but diagnostically.
* Martyrdom imagery tied to purity and corruption of the church.
* Warning against hierarchical drift within Protestantism.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory tone warning Protestant readers.
* Polemical sharpness must not be softened.
* Historical judgment intertwined with moral exhortation.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "uomtvistelig Kjendsgjerning" – an incontestable fact; rhetorical assertion of certainty.
* "stenhaarde Træk" – strokes of stone; vivid metaphor for an unalterable historical record.
* "Veien altid er bred" – echo of Matthew 7:13 (broad is the way).
* "ingen maa undres" – exhortative idiom: let no one be surprised.
* "Kirke i en Forstand som ingen anden" – church in a sense unmatched by any other.

KJV parallels are natural for:

* "broad is the way" (Matt. 7:13)
* martyr language (Acts, Revelation)

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: If a free church means independence from the state, the Catholic Church historically qualifies.
* Historical clarification: Its political entanglement arose from supremacy over the state, not dependence.
* Methodological claim: Any serious study of free churches must begin with Catholic history.
* Polemical warning: Protestant rejection of Catholicism often aims to avoid self-examination.
* Contemporary application: American Protestantism stands where Rome once stood.
* Historical reflection: The Catholic Church evolved from suffering martyr church to persecuting power.
* Concluding question: Is this path inevitable for a free church, or a tragic deviation?

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 7:13–14 – broad way vs. narrow way.
* Acts / Revelation – blood witnesses (martyrs).
* Pauline warnings about Antichrist (2 Thess. 2).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain warning tone toward Protestants.
* Preserve gravity in discussing martyrdom and persecution.
* Retain sharp critique of fanatic Protestantism.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa begynde" – must begin.
* "kan derfor ikke være nogen Tvil underkastet" – cannot therefore be doubted.
* "ingen maa undres" – no one must be surprised.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Frikirke – Free Church
* katholiske Kirke – the Catholic Church
* Antikrist – Antichrist
* Kirkeveien – the way of the Church

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Stone-written history.
* Broad and narrow way.
* Path vs. byway imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Historical admiration vs. moral horror.
* Earnest warning vs. reflective questioning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences.
* Retain sermonic buildup and rhetorical pauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

It is an incontestable fact that if by a Free Church one understands a church that is independent of the State, then there has been and still is a great and powerful Christian Church that deserves this name; it is the Catholic. That this Church at various times has deeply entangled itself in affairs of state is here of no consequence, since this did not rest upon dependence upon the State, but upon a supremacy over the State, which it precisely possessed as a Free Church. In later times, however, this supremacy over the State has in many ways been compelled to be relinquished.

It can therefore not be subject to any doubt that a serious investigation of the historical development of the Free Church, of its dangers and its advantages, must begin with the Catholic Church, because there we possess the longest experience and the most legible records. There it is written in strokes of stone how a Free Church labors under the influence of the world, and what we are liable to inherit from it if it begins in the same manner. For however much one in our own day, in fanatical Protestantism, may wish to exclude it from the number of Free Churches, we must never forget that it has been Church in a sense such as no other has been. And we add that the strong zeal to deny the Catholic Church its right is to a great extent grounded in a fear lest any instruction or warning should be drawn from its sorrowful history. The Pope is called Antichrist, and all Catholic endeavors unchristian, in order that no one may be led to examine whether the spirit of the Antichrist and hierarchical tendencies might also be found among ourselves. We stand in America in a manner similar to that in which the Catholic Church once stood in the Roman Empire, and no one ought to marvel if there is danger of going the same way now as then, since the way is always broad toward Catholicism, but exceedingly narrow toward a truly free Christian Church.

The Catholic Church has not always been what it is today. It has suffered and struggled; it has labored and prayed; it has had blood-witnesses and fire-witnesses, before it came so far that it itself gave the “heretics” their blood-witnesses and their belts upon the stake. From the days of the Apostles down to our own time it has one single continuous history, which never seems broken or interrupted, so that we ask ourselves with dread whether it is indeed the case that the Free Church has no other path to tread; and we are driven to the most careful examination of whether this in full earnestness is the way of the Church, or whether it might perhaps be a byway.
