STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Frikirke" – not merely "free church" in a modern denominational sense, but a church not bound to the state, with strong ecclesiological implications.
* "katholske Frikirke" – refers to the early universal (catholic) church before medieval Roman institutionalization; must not be confused with modern Roman Catholicism.
* "Guds Rige / Himmeriges Rige" – biblically charged terms requiring consistency with KJV diction (Kingdom of God / Kingdom of Heaven).
* "Gjerings Øiemed" – teleological term (aim/purpose of Christ’s work), not mere activity.
* "Grundvold" – foundational metaphor with Pauline resonance (cf. 1 Cor. 3).
* "Forvisning" – strong inner certainty, not subjective opinion.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with layered subordinate clauses and rhetorical buildup.
* Heavy use of semicolons and commas to sustain sermonic cadence.
* Contrastive pivots ("Men naar Begyndelsen var saa god…") that must remain forceful.

Theological Hazards:

* Ecclesiology: Church as Bride of Christ.
* Eschatology: Kingdom of God present on earth with eternal fulfillment.
* Christology: Christ as second Adam, firstborn of a new humanity.
* Soteriology and perseverance under suffering.

Voice Hazards:

* Elevated, exhortational, quasi-homiletic tone.
* Triumphal yet sober reflection on martyrdom.
* Risk of flattening into descriptive church history instead of theological exhortation.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "en Gnist af Kristendom" – idiom meaning even the smallest true presence of Christianity; should retain metaphor of spark.
* "Mørket et Lys omkring dem" – paradoxical biblical idiom (cf. Ps. 139:12).
* "styrtede sig til Kampen" – vivid martial imagery; must not be softened.
* "faa efterfølge baade deres Tro og deres Død" – pietistic ideal of martyrdom; echoes Heb. 13:7.

KJV Parallels:

* Kingdom language (Matt. 6, Matt. 13)
* Armor of God (Eph. 6)
* Zion imagery (Heb. 12; Rev. 21)

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Acknowledgment of historical scope too vast for full treatment.
2. Statement of purpose: to identify dangers that befell the early catholic free church.
3. Assertion of the true goal of every genuine free church: the Kingdom of God.
4. Historical exemplification: early Christians and Roman catacombs.
5. Description of their eschatological hope and martyr faith.
6. Normative claim: without this conviction, no church deserves the name Bride of Christ.
7. Transition to problem: how did such a beginning lead to the present corrupted end?

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Kingdom of God / Kingdom of Heaven – Synoptic Gospels.
* Christ as second Adam – Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15.
* Firstborn – Colossians 1:18.
* Zion – Hebrews 12; Revelation.
* Armor of God – Ephesians 6.
* Martyr crowns and palms – Revelation 7:9; James 1:12.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain triumphant yet suffering church imagery.
* Do not soften critique implied in final rhetorical question.
* Preserve absolutist statements about what constitutes a true church.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan" / "maa" implications retained as necessity, not suggestion.
* "har aldrig fortjent" must remain categorical.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Guds Rige / Himmeriges Rige → Kingdom of God / Kingdom of Heaven
* Frikirke → Free Church (capitalized for conceptual consistency)
* Herre → Lord
* Frelser → Saviour

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Rock / foundation imagery preserved.
* Martial metaphors (armor, battle, victory) preserved.
* Light/darkness paradox preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Awe and admiration for early church.
* Solemn warning implicit for later churches.
* Sharp contrast between beginning and end.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Commas and semicolons retained to support proclamation rhythm.

STEP 11: FINAL ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

It is impossible here, within a few words, to pass through this entire long development. We have here only briefly to point out the dangers under which the catholic Free Church succumbed, so that everyone may judge how near these same dangers lie to every Free Church.

There is a goal set before every Free Church that has even a spark of Christianity within it: it is the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of Heaven upon earth, with its eternal consummation in heaven, this is the aim of Christ’s work; and this Kingdom He Himself is—just as He is the second Adam, or the firstborn of the new race of mankind—the living foundation of the eternal Zion. Never has this goal shone more clearly for any communion than for the first poor Christians in the midst of the heathen. Nowhere has this goal been drawn in such pure and radiant colors as for the Christians in the catacombs of Rome. Here, in these burial vaults beneath the great city of the world, where the splendor and corruption of a world-empire roared above them in all its greatness and abomination, the darkness became a light round about them, when their hearts were lifted up in faith toward the eternal glory in which their sufferings and tribulations were to be forgotten for evermore. There they felt the powers of the new world stirring within them, and in hope they saw the empire crumble into dust before the Lord, who is at hand. It was the free Church which, clothed in the full armor of the Lord, cast itself into the battle, while the bodies of martyrs were laid to rest with songs of victory, and their graves were marked with the crown of honor and the palm of triumph by those who hoped to follow after both their faith and their death. That Church which is not permeated by this unshakable conviction, that the Kingdom of God in eternal glory is its goal, has never deserved the name of the Bride of Christ.

It is this strong life of the Spirit and this world-overcoming faith in the Saviour and His work which constitute the Christian foundation upon which the Roman Church rests—and no Free Church can rest upon anything else. It must have firm ground upon the Rock, the eternal Rock, if it is to dare to believe in its eternal calling and its eternal life. But if the beginning was so good, how then has the outcome become what we see before our eyes?
