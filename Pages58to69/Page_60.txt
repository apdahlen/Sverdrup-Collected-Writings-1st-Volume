STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Frikirke" – carries historical-theological meaning beyond simply "free church"; must retain ecclesial and doctrinal nuance.
* "Kristendheden" – not merely Christianity as belief, but the whole Christian world or Christendom.
* "Frihedsudvikling" – development of freedom in a political-historical sense, not generic liberty.
* "Selvstyre" – self-government, with political resonance.
* "Absolutismen" – specific reference to political absolutism; metaphorical transfer to church polity.
* "Vel" – welfare / true good, not merely benefit.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with layered parallelisms and balanced contrasts.
* Repeated "ligemeget ... som ..." constructions must be preserved rhythmically.
* Semicolon logic and careful argumentative pivots.

Theological Hazards:

* Church–state distinction must remain doctrinally precise.
* References to denial or confession of Christianity must not be softened.
* Implicit Lutheran concern for the church’s true good.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, reflective, didactic tone must not be modernized.
* Rhetorical restraint and measured seriousness must be preserved.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "der raabes paa den fra alle Hold" – idiom of public clamoring; rendered as "cried for on all sides."
* "tabt Sag" – a lost cause; political idiom with rhetorical weight.
* "gjøre sig rede for" – to give an account to oneself; rendered as "to gain clarity" or "to make clear to ourselves."
* "tage sig iagt" – to take heed; strong biblical resonance (cf. KJV "take heed").

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Observation: widespread demand for a free church in the modern age.
* Inference: the term must carry divergent meanings.
* Analysis of motives behind the demand (political, ideological, spiritual).
* Problem: lack of a fixed definition of "free church."
* Claim: America provides a unique setting to clarify its meaning.
* Justification: historical perspective is necessary before judgment.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* "tage sig iagt" echoes biblical exhortations to watchfulness.
* Moral-historical reflection follows the cadence of wisdom literature.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sober, reflective seriousness.
* Avoid rhetorical inflation or casual phrasing.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity in phrases like "med Nødvendighed."
* Retain force in "maa vi tro" as logical compulsion, not mild suggestion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Frikirke" consistently as "the free church."
* "Kirken" capitalized where ecclesiological, not generic.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Political metaphors (lost cause, development of freedom) retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Balance between descriptive neutrality and implicit warning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where deliberate.
* Parallel structures retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\subsubsection{The Free Church in History}

[Editorial Note: A manuscript which, judging from the handwriting, belongs to the very earliest years after the author’s arrival in America. It is presumably the manuscript of a speech; at any rate, I have found no trace that it was ever published before. See moreover the note on page 58. — Ed.]

Throughout Christendom, in these days when the development of the world’s freedom has shown the way to self-government, there is a living question concerning the free Church. When there is clamor on all sides, without distinction—by conservatives as well as by liberals, by monarchists as well as by republicans, by those who fervently confess the Christian faith as well as by those who fervently deny Christianity—this leads of necessity to the thought that this name, “the free Church,” carries with it many different conceptions. At once we must suppose that some who desire a free Church would therein have a substitute for absolutism, which is a lost cause in the political sphere, while others would therein seek the same freedom as in the state, and others again perhaps seek the Church’s true good, regardless of whither this might lead them.

If, then, the free Church has as yet no definite meaning, but merely designates the Church which is independent of the state, and which otherwise each person imagines for himself as he will, it is evident that here in America—where no other kind of Church exists than the free Church—it will be most timely to attempt to make clear to ourselves what this is to mean.

Meanwhile, the Church is not of yesterday, nor is America the only place where there has been a free Church; and it is therefore fitting for us first to cast a very brief glance backward, to see how the free Church has been before our own days, and to what it has developed, in order that we may, if possible, learn to take heed of the dangers and to make use of the advantages in that condition of affairs in which we are set.
