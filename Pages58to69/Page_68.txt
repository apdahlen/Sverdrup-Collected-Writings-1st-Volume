STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Hedenske, Frikirken, ren Lære, Omvendelse med Sværd, saliggjørende Magt – terms with specific 19th-century Lutheran and ecclesiological weight.
* Ordets Lys – biblical metaphor requiring scriptural resonance.
* Riges Børn – fixed biblical phrase with eschatological meaning.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with multiple subordinate clauses and semicolon pivots.
* Sermonic rhythm that must not be modernized into short declaratives.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the free Church vs. Roman Church.
* Salvation, grace mediated by church authority.
* Conversion by coercion vs. faith awakened by the Word.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, polemical Lutheran critique.
* Warning against ecclesiastical power replacing God’s kingdom.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Omvendelse med Sværd" – forced conversion; echoes coercive baptism history.
* "Ordets Lys" – cf. John 1; KJV diction suitable.
* "Riges Børn" – Matthew 8:12; must retain KJV phrasing.
* "yderste Mørke" – biblical hell imagery.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Contrast between pagan masses under Constantine and forcibly baptized peoples.
* Description of danger posed to the free Church.
* Church’s choice: awaken consciences or exploit helplessness.
* Historical failure leading to Roman ecclesiology.
* Identification of two foundational corrupt principles.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 8:12 – children of the kingdom cast into outer darkness.
* Pauline imagery of maturity (Ephesians 4).
* Johannine light imagery.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain polemical sharpness.
* Preserve warning tone and moral urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kunde enten … eller" – real alternatives, not mild options.
* Necessity and inevitability in doctrinal critique.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Frikirken = the free Church
* Naade = grace
* ren Lære = pure doctrine

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Light, bondage, sword, seed imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Historical description → warning → doctrinal indictment.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intended.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

But the situation here was nevertheless very different. The heathen masses who followed Constantine bore within themselves the whole of the old pagan culture, and they were mighty to wage a struggle within the Church, which had as its consequence a powerful unfolding of ecclesiastical energies in defense of the pure doctrine. By contrast, the heathen peoples who, with the sword over their heads, had been compelled to receive baptism, who had lost their freedom and their religion at one and the same time, lay far more will-less in the hand of the Church. They offered, indeed, a natural resistance, such as the flesh always offers; yet it was essentially a resistance of lust and ungodliness, which, because it wounded the conscience, made the souls all the more easily predisposed, in other respects, to suffer under the Church’s power.

Here there arose a new danger that threatened the free Church. What was it to do with all these new members? They themselves could do nothing; they were just as helpless as they were ignorant. The Church could either labor to let the light of the Word shine upon them, so that they might be awakened to become independent and self-acting members of the Church; or it could let them lie helpless, and make use of their lack of independence in order to lay them under itself, always pretending that it was mighty to save them. The Church did indeed strive, as befitted the free Church, in its best moments and through its best powers, to raise these peoples to the maturity of manhood; but alas, it grew weary before the time, and the evil beginning—conversion by the sword—received an even more corrupt continuation.

\textbf{For the free Church is in a peculiar manner tempted, precisely because it is Church, to forget that the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness. And the delusion of the saving Church allured with double force there, where a multitude of ignorant heathen—whom one took pleasure in comparing to children—lay subdued and bowed at the foot of the Church. To take them all into its bosom, to lift them into heaven, to pray them in unto God, and from God to dispense grace to them—that was the Church’s joyful thought of victory. There was no other way: the doctrine of grace-dispensing, saving Church had almost by force to press itself upon the Roman Church.

And if we will truly go to the bottom of the entire Roman free-church system, wherein the kingdom of God was betrayed for power, we find that there are two gigantic seeds of injustice which were laid down in it at the very beginning, and which thereafter—constantly kept alive by the evil spirit of heartlessness and world-covetousness—have grown throughout the whole of its development and given it the character we know so well. The one is the authority of the pure doctrine,\footnote{Paper pope. — Present Ed} over against which no criticism is permitted—not even the judgment of God the Holy Spirit in God’s own Word—once the bishop of Rome has given the doctrine his sanction. The other is the Church’s power to grant salvation, so that all who receive grace only from the Church and in obedience to the Church are saved, whether they live in God or not.}
