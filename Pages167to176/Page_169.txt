STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Hauge took with full earnestness the Word of God, that one must obey God rather than men; and in defiance of human laws, and in defiance of the civil and ecclesiastical officials who sought to use these laws to hinder the testimony of Christ among the people, Hauge went his afflicted way through our nation, to blessing for thousands—yes, to living joy for many generations.

The cause which was thus expressed at the beginning of the century awakened ever a strong spiritual movement among the people. This is not the place to recount how Hauge’s practical application of the freedom of conscience over against all human commandments, and his patient sufferings for the right of conscience and of religion, became a seed of freedom in the whole course of our national development. Yet it ought nevertheless to be mentioned, especially now when in our own days one would deny Christianity all significance for popular freedom and assert it to be a yoke of bondage that ought to be shaken off as soon as possible. History bears witness just as surely that the Gospel of Christ, which gave the conscience its freedom over against all human commandments, is in truth the primal fountain from which the entire development of freedom in the human race has taken its origin. Thus it is also the case in the Norwegian people. Hauge’s awakening became, like every genuine ecclesial awakening, a mighty power to “put down the mighty from their thrones and exalt them of low degree,” to “raise up the poor out of the dust and lift the needy from the dunghill.” Not only did Hauge’s personal sufferings awaken a powerful sense of the injustice of persecution; but many of Hauge’s friends have in truth been brought forward by the power of the awakening and by the might of the Spirit to stand among the foremost of the land in the most diverse callings.

The movement which had been awakened through Hauge shared this with all true Christianity, that it was not so bound to his person that it ceased—or even declined in strength—at his death. It had life-power in itself through the Word and Spirit of God, so that it propagated itself and grew after this witness of the Lord himself had long since been laid in the grave.

Nor were witnesses lacking who were awakened through Hauge’s activity; they took up the work where Hauge left off, and there may be named a whole series of men who labored as revival preachers and as leaders among the awakened after Hauge. Most widely known are Jens Tønsgård from Tøier, Anders Haabe from Sognfjord, John Haugvaldstad, and several others. And that it might also this time be fulfilled what the Lord says: “Ye shall be my witnesses unto the ends of the earth,” He so ordered it that from this circle of witnesses there arose the thought of forming a Norwegian heathen mission society, so that the seed which was sown in the valleys of Norway now bears fruit far away among the blinded heathen peoples of Africa. Wondrous is the power of the Gospel of Christ—the power of God unto salvation for every one that believeth.
