STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Forsoning" carries ecclesial and relational weight, not merely social reconciliation.
* "troende Lægfolk" denotes awakened, believing laity, not generic church members.
* "indre Kald" is a theological term (vocatio interna), not subjective inclination.
* "Statspræsterne" refers polemically to state-aligned clergy.
* "vak­te Lægfolk" indicates pietistically awakened believers.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, paratactic sentences with semicolon logic must be preserved.
* Historical narrative interwoven with evaluative judgments.
* Embedded contrasts and concessive clauses.

Theological Hazards:

* Repentance, vocation, pastoral office, conscience, and witness.
* Clergy–laity conflict rooted in persecution of Haugeans.
* Suspicion of non-experiential Christianity.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, evaluative Lutheran historiography.
* Moral seriousness toward clerical failure.
* Warning tone against superficial theology.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kløften var for dyb" – metaphor of an unbridgeable chasm.
* "dyrekjøbte Menighed" echoes 1 Peter 1:18–19 (bought with a price).
* "Vidner" resonates with Acts 1:8.
* "Norges Dæmring" / "Opvaagnen" – poetic-historical idiom contrasting decline and awakening.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Despite reform, reconciliation between clergy and believing laity failed.
* Cause: Clerical injustice and unwillingness to repent.
* Development: Decline in theological depth after Hersleb and Stenersen.
* Cultural Distraction: National and literary संघर्ष overshadowed theology.
* Consequence: Continued suspicion and conflict, even in America.
* Conclusion: Folk-cultural projects failed to inspire confidence in serious Christianity.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* "Vidner" – Acts 1:8.
* "Sjælehyrder" – John 10; 1 Peter 5.
* "dyrekjøbte Menighed" – 1 Peter 1:18–19; Acts 20:28.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain moral evaluation of clergy.
* Preserve lament over missed reconciliation.
* Avoid neutral academic tone.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity in "rigtig og nødvendig".
* Maintain impossibility implied in "kom ikke istand".

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Forsoning → reconciliation
* Kald → calling
* Menighed → congregation
* Lægfolk → laity

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve chasm imagery.
* Maintain awakening/dawning metaphors.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Joy over reform vs. sorrow over failure.
* Cultural enthusiasm vs. spiritual deficiency.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences and rhetorical pacing suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

One may therefore say, as the general result of these considerations, that although through the labors of Hersleb and Stenersen a new direction was indeed called forth within the clergy, a great and joyful change for the better, yet no reconciliation between the clergy and the believing laity came into being. Such reconciliation was sorely needed soon after the injustices committed against Hans Nielsen Hauge and his friends; but it did not come so soon or so easily as might have been desired. The chasm was too deep, the mistrust too pervasive. It was the clergy who had committed the wrong, and it was not willing to make toward the believing laity such an approach as was both right and necessary.

When Hersleb and Stenersen died (1835 and 1836), there came in their place as theological teachers at the University men who indeed belonged to the same general tendency, but who did not attain to the same height as the two earlier professors. Professors Dietrichson, Keyser, and Kaurin were not able to exercise any particularly strong influence upon the theological students. The theologians, as a rule, read for their examinations much as jurists and physicians did. Of any inner calling from God to be witnesses of Jesus Christ and shepherds of souls for His dearly bought congregation there was little talk.

Moreover, the minds of the student world in this period were greatly distracted by other interests. It was the time which the poet Welhaven called “Norway’s Dusk,” but which perhaps might more rightly be called Norway’s Awakening. The struggle between the Danish and the Norwegian tendencies in literature, art, and politics was so stormy and clamorous, and the studying youth were so powerfully shaken and stirred by it, that the theological students did not obtain sufficient quiet for deeper theological study and for an inward devotion to their divine calling. Henrik Wergeland and Johan Sebastian Welhaven were leaders of the two literary and aesthetic parties, and the influence which these two men exercised upon the youth far outweighed the influence exerted by the quiet and modest theological professors upon their theological students. If the studying youth possessed any higher interest than that of obtaining an examination and a comfortable home on a Norwegian parsonage, it was rather popular, national, and literary interests that animated them than Christian and theological ones.

The theologians of this period who possessed some deeper Christian view of life were still influenced by Grundtvig and Wexels; and among the people they were therefore still regarded with suspicious eyes. In America this opposition therefore at once comes to light in the struggle between Elling Eielsen and his friends on the one side and the “state pastors” on the other.

How deeply popular interests laid hold of the theologians of this time may be seen when one recalls how Jørgen Moe labored to collect folk tales and M. B. Landstad to collect Norwegian folk ballads. However meritorious these labors were in their own kind, they were nevertheless far from suited to inspire the awakened laity with any confidence in the seriousness of the Christianity in question.
