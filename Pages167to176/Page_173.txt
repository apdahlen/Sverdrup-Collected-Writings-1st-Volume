STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Grundtvigianisme" — historically loaded theological-cultural term; must not be reduced to generic influence.
* "Præstelærere" — not merely "teachers" but clerical-theological instructors with ecclesial authority.
* "vantru" — stronger than "unbelief"; implies doctrinal unfaithfulness or spiritual infidelity.
* "redeligt" — moral-spiritual integrity, not merely honesty.
* "Virksomhed" — ministry/activity with theological weight.
* "Høiskole" — early Norwegian university; not a modern folk high school.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with embedded clauses and appositions.
* Quoted material with layered metaphors and enumerations.
* Sermonic cadence that should not be fragmented.

Theological Hazards:

* Descriptions of Christianity as "old, simple, despised by the world" — echoes of Lutheran theology of the cross.
* Light/darkness imagery tied to ecclesial decline and renewal.
* Divine agency (“Herren var med dem”).

Voice Hazards:

* Evaluative tone combining historical judgment and reverent admiration.
* Risk of flattening solemn, testimonial language into neutral academic prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "den mørkeste Tid" — idiomatic for deepest spiritual/theological decline.
* "klæber ved dem" — metaphor of flaws clinging; should be preserved.
* "stod ... ved Stolen" — literal lectern/pulpit; implies authoritative teaching office.
* "vidnede redeligt" — biblical witness language (cf. John 1).
* "Lysets og Livets" — Johannine biblical resonance.
* "Gudsdommelige Kilde" — source imagery rooted in Scripture.

KJV Parallels:

* "the Lord was with them" (cf. Acts).
* "light and life" (John 1:4).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Stenersen’s intellectual alignment with Grundtvig and contemporary criticism.
2. Biographical framing of Hersleb and Stenersen (youth, education, tenure).
3. Historical-theological context mitigating their shortcomings.
4. Testimonial validation through disciple W. A. Wexels.
5. Concluding affirmation of divine blessing and lasting ecclesial impact.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Light vs. darkness — John 1; Ephesians 5.
* Witness/testimony — Johannine and Acts motifs.
* God forming instruments — Pauline imagery (2 Tim 2:20).
* Word-pairs: wisdom/righteousness/power/freedom — 1 Corinthians 1.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain evaluative gravity.
* Preserve admiration without sentimentality.
* Maintain clear distinction between historical critique and theological praise.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" constructions rendered as moral necessity ("must one rather marvel").
* Avoid weakening into optional judgments.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kristendom = Christianity (capitalized where confessional).
* Herren = the Lord.
* Virksomhed = ministry / work (context-sensitive but consistent).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Darkness/light imagery retained.
* Source/fountain metaphors preserved.
* Instruments/tools imagery maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Critical observation → charitable reassessment → reverent testimony.
* Do not equalize or neutralize contrasts.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and enumerations.
* Maintain rhythmic accumulation in quoted testimony.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Stenersen also, who was somewhat younger than Hersleb and Grundtvig, was influenced by Grundtvig and was particularly drawn to his view of history. He likewise declared himself publicly to be his friend and follower, and Bishop Pavels complained of his “excessive Grundtvigianism, intolerance, one-sidedness, and peculiar opinions.”

Hersleb was, when in 1813 he became a teacher of theology at the University in Christiania, not yet thirty years of age (born in 1784 in Alstahaug parish in Helgeland). Stenersen was, when in 1814 he became a university lecturer, about twenty-five years old (born 1789 at Mo in Søndre). For approximately twenty-one years these men labored together as teachers of pastors, until death called them both away. The younger, Stenersen, died first, namely on the 17th of April 1835, at an age of a little over forty-five years. Hersleb died on the 12th of September 1836.

In order to be in some measure just toward these men, one must remember that they received their entire theological education from Denmark, and that their upbringing falls within the darkest period which the Lutheran Church has experienced since the Reformation. When this is taken into consideration, one must rather marvel at the light and clarity that are to be found in these men’s work, in speech and in writing, than complain of the shortcomings that cling to them.

One of their very earliest and most gifted disciples was the well-known pastor W. A. Wexels. He writes of them: “Their legacy will be kindly; with a truthful voice it will proclaim that in the first decades after the establishment of Norway’s university there stood, in the midst of a faithless and violently agitated age, two friends side by side as teachers of pastors from the chair, and bore faithful witness to the old, guileless Christianity, despised by the world, as the divine source of light and life, of wisdom and righteousness, of power and freedom; and the Lord was with them, and their labor was blessed by Him and powerfully contributed to forming for Him instruments for the proclamation of His name among Norway’s mountains.”
