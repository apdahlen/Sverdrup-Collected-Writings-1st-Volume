STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "aandelige Bevægelse" – spiritual movement with revivalist connotations, not generic spirituality.
* "Lægmandsbevægelse" – lay movement within church context, not anti-clerical by definition.
* "vakte" – the awakened; a technical pietistic term.
* "Sværmeri" – religious enthusiasm with pejorative rationalist overtones.
* "Geistlighed" – clergy as an estate/order.
* "aandelige Veiledere" – spiritual guides with pastoral authority.
* "aandelig Nød" – spiritual distress, not emotional discomfort.
* "Menighed" – congregation, ecclesial body.
* "Rationalismens Side" – theological rationalism, not generic reason.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with moral causality.
* Parenthetical historical framing (1814–1850).
* Sermonic pacing and cumulative clauses.
* Quoted anecdote with abrupt tonal shift.

Theological Hazards:

* Concepts of awakening, salvation anxiety, pastoral duty.
* Spiritual coldness vs. living faith.
* Distrust between clergy and laity with ecclesiological weight.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, wounded, admonitory tone.
* Moral indictment without polemic exaggeration.
* Pastoral sympathy for the awakened laity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "bleven vakt" – awakened by God to awareness of sin and salvation; cf. Acts 16:14.
* "Bekymring for sin Sjæls Frelse" – anxiety for one’s soul’s salvation; Luke 10:42.
* "Dødskulde" – spiritual coldness; Rev. 3:15–16 resonance.
* The anecdote functions as moral exemplum, not satire.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Norwegian revival was fundamentally a lay movement opposed or neglected by clergy.
* Evidence: Clerical scorn, anecdotal illustration.
* Effect: Deep emotional and ecclesial injury among the people.
* Historical consequence: Long-term mistrust between congregation and clergy.
* Qualification: Acknowledges later clerical change, but stresses lasting damage.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Awakening language echoes Pauline and Lucan conversion motifs.
* Pastoral failure contrasts with shepherd imagery (Ezekiel 34).
* Coldness imagery recalls Laodicea (Revelation 3).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain moral seriousness and restrained indignation.
* Preserve sympathy for wounded conscience.
* Avoid ironic or modern distancing.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan det ikke undre os" – must not surprise us.
* "maa dog ingen tænke" – let no one suppose.
* Maintain necessity and moral consequence.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "vakte" – the awakened.
* "Geistlighed" – clergy.
* "Menighed" – congregation.
* "aandelig" – spiritual (consistently).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Emotional wounds as something laid in the depths of the heart.
* Coldness striking from churchmen.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Narrative calm → moral pain → sober historical judgment.
* No emotional flattening.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and semicolon turns.
* Allow breath-length clauses suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

This strong spiritual movement within the Norwegian people was thus, through and through, a lay movement. Only few priests granted it their approval or encouragement; the great majority of the Norwegian clergy saw in the movement a more or less dangerous religious enthusiasm.

Even if these awakened ones were not, in the strictest sense, persecuted as Hauge himself had been, they were nevertheless all too often mocked and despised and deeply wounded by those who ought to have been their spiritual guides. Such treatment always gives pain, and especially among the Norwegian people. Our people have a warm heart and a strong sense of honor, and there was often laid deep bitterness in the depths of the heart when spiritual distress and the soul’s most sacred stirrings were met with cold contempt and condescending superiority.

Many examples are told of such heedless and unchristian conduct. A man in one of our deepest fjords, where nature itself already made the people somber and cautious, had been awakened to anxiety for his soul’s salvation. In his distress he gathered courage and went to the pastor. He found him standing and polishing his rifle after a hunting trip. The man explained his condition to the pastor, who listened from the door to the sitting room and called out to his wife: “Mother, give this man some medicine for his stomach; he is not well today.” Such a word is enough to plant hurt in a Norwegian man for his entire lifetime, and many a time enough to sow evil suspicion in a whole congregation against everything that bears the name of priest. If many such sufferings were cast into the hearts of the Norwegian common people, it cannot surprise us that in the period from 1814 to 1850 no strong trust grew up between the Norwegian congregation and the Norwegian clergy.

Therefore, however, no one should suppose that no change at all took place within the Norwegian clergy during this time. The point is only this: that there remained, on the side of Rationalism, a good measure of condescending superiority seated in the offices, and that this wrought immeasurable harm through the manner in which it confronted the awakened people. There prevailed a mutual suspicion and a mutual estrangement that could not be overcome in a short time. Shy and fearful, the awakened laity drew together by themselves; they feared nothing more than the deathly chill which so often struck them from the men of the Church.
